<Title>Titter ye not: it's Bettina Arndt men wonderful</Title>
<Contents>Liberated women confusing hell men Like many people I confused tagline story Fairfax papers yesterday How liberated women it And why Should put jail I read story and like many people time I got end I even confused But suddenly everything made sense I realised piece written Bettina Arndt Sex therapist clinical psychologist author whos recent assertions wives sex husbands even dont want to Julia Gillard setting bad example role model married men like porn women dont I thought Id like clear confusion explaining Bettina trying say Dont thank me Its I do Youre welcome A YOUNG man woman friendly chat yoga class The fresh faced blonde seems relaxed freezes Did look chest asks angrily arms folded What described YouTube comedy sketch It permitted indeed preferable use Internet comedy sketches evidence Its generalization Its fact Like Bible Yep mutters bloke sheepishly Her response fierce Cant I go one yoga class without ogled jerk She fierce Perhaps period Instead cowed takes on launching passionate defence action It dangerous man take feisty lady on Because definitely liberated woman possibly feminist Which like terrorists RadPads Feminists sexually frustrated hate men He brave hero She wrong And angry Which unladylike If really didnt want stare beautiful breasts youd wearing something purple sports bra covering maybe one third perfect tits Glancing looking staring ogling exactly thing And perfect tits compliment He thinks shes pretty She flattered This exchange typical frequent occurrence perfect tits enjoy provoking men flaunting them I know I perfect tits I constantly flaunt To confuse men He argues suggesting among things hes biologically programmed scan life giving breasts future offspring The assertion its biological wins arguments immediately Because choice intelligent beings rise primitive instincts Its called Arndts Law Hes cute passionate ultimately convincing She ends asking coffee Hes good punching well weight If liberated women there NOT try home It wont work This comedy sketch NOT real life He coffee felt sorry her And wanted keep looking tits This skit New York media company The Kloons attracted 1million hits YouTube The million hits You Tube nothing fact word TIT title skit features attractive woman lovely breasts Breasts would never encourage anyone click link Nor would extensive coverage mainstream press legitimizing titillation concern confused men word feminist leading click bait articles mentioning skit generating hits The producers say wasnt meant joke to investigate deep chasm men women I know thinking wrong The idea producers retrospectively claiming credit deeper profound social comment originally joke preposterous That chasm indeed deep growing It deep growing You dont need evidence It is Ask anyone If stand still listen hear it So many women feeling entitled dress like  bare breasts enticing flesh squeezed shortest tightest clothing ENTITLED Thats right feel entitled How dare they Who told right wear whatever want without prior approval permission man government What next Women feeling entitled equal pay The vote Female bosses Lady doctors Women drivers Lesbians Everywhere look women stepping dressed provocatively Yes everywhere Just look Particularly Tehran Kabul And no women wearing want selecting wear using criteria provocative To confuse men Men play football go jogging get shirtless dressed scantily wearing cool comfortable And right Women visually stimulated mens part naked bodies And men definitely visually stimulated mens naked bodies They men And men like looking women bristling wrong man shows enjoys display Yes Bristling And bristling uncomfortable And confusing But bristle wrong man appears enjoying display And display On purpose And wrong men right men And Bettina knows psychologist not So shut might learn something And men  well state confusion Yes All them If man confused And woman its fault I hope youre happy yourselves You breaking world There cocky

tell women stop getting raped Because rape women wearing Old unattractive women women wearing modest clothing never get raped Only girls short skirts low cut tops And raped wear clothes If wearing different clothes would get raped While women claim dress slutty make feel good They claim Women would know think That others like Bettina men decide the fact remains that like protesters main message sent flaunting womens sexual power Its UP YOU gesture provocative kind Flaunting Not affirming They saying youre allowed rape sluts either They flaunting its provoking inflaming men Its humiliating
