<Title>Afghanistan and the duty of our representatives</Title>
<Contents>In earlier article I called responsibility given representatives Parliament decide merits arguments continuing involvement war AfghanistanThe fundamental issue whether still justify exposing troops combatants ever increasing number innocent civilians death suffering clearly much moral issue issue involving national interestsNormally would think issue involving killing human beings would call conscience vote This case debates past death penalty abortion stem cell research It also case debate euthanasiaHowever neither major party permitted conscience vote debate war indeed vote all even though involves matters life death affecting thousands people say matter There probably two reasons thisThe first preserving Executives exclusive power decide issues relating war The second threat vote might pose party unityBecause Realpolitik firmly entrenched pressure follow party line extreme becomes even important consider responsibility elected representatives challenge status quo grave moral issues arise This requires examination particular nature duties towards people elected themThere two competing views The popular view states members act accordance wishes electorate According view members merely delegates constituency entitled substitute personal judgments constituents Their difficulty determining bound follow Knowledge electorate targeted opinion polls essential requirements hereThe better constitutional view however states member personal non delegable duty serve interests constituents necessarily reflect opinions wishes According view member like trustee duty bound exercise personal judgment decide issue meritsWhile done behalf constituents nation whole members duty trustee best interests form opinion reflect opinions others His difficulty one exercising personal judgment reconcile competing interests Here knowledge issues evaluation arguments relevant evidence essential requirementsThe distinction though subtle crucial first enunciated great conservative political philosopher Edmund Burke famous address electors Bristol 1780  ought happiness glory representative live  unreserved communication constituents Their wishes ought great weight him opinion high respect business unremitted attentionIt duty sacrifice repose pleasures satisfactions theirs all ever cases prefer interest ownBut unbiased opinion mature judgment enlightened conscience ought sacrifice you man set men living Your representative owes you industry only judgment betrays instead serving sacrifices opinionAny fair reading actions four independents deciding party would support form minority government would adopted Burkes conservative principled view duty In end constituents nation got deserved best efforts elected representatives make minds make difficult choices behalf even disagreed them For Burke primary moral duty every elected representative ParliamentWhile would obvious independents position far less clear members elected party representatives How classic theory members duty constituents qualified members duty party Once again two competing viewsThe first states that elected member party party platform member duty bound delegate personal responsibility party The party decides member vote issues The concession issues party leadership member allows conscience vote Very occasionally member cross floor issue disproportionately affects local electorate Both exceptions suggest duty party despite rigorously enforced absoluteThe alternative view member exercise personal duty decides best interests constituents nation whole served following party policy contributed developing elected fulfill For bread butter issues course defensible But distinction again though subtle crucial The member reserves right decide ultimately issues fall category party Such member exercising power delegating abrogating itWhile political parties exert considerable pressure members toe party line recognise extreme cases members conscience simply wont allow so usually asked vote contrary deeply held religious conviction held prior electionIn cases LiberalNational Parties also tolerate member crossing floor time time policy issues conscience reasons case Malcolm Turnbull others climate change Bill clear example Generally Labor Party frowns exercise independent judgment party membersSo free debate war Afghanistan still progress Well clear four independents decided would voted accordingly Of party members Anna Burke Lab Kelvin Thomson Lab Jill Hall Lab Mal Washer Lib courageously exercised independent judgment contrary partys policy All speakers far followed party line While people may question integrity members least prepared nail colours mast entitled judged accordingly The test integrity would whether would held stated views leadership decided last moment early withdrawalBut make members remain silent required vote Because silence interpreted differently different people   either tacit assent refusal actively support   incumbent show clearly stand Their failure indicate whether support continuing involvement clear case abrogation responsibility   result perhaps self interest indifference cowardiceIf support continuing involvement war Afghanistan overwhelming major parties assert vote motion effect And members allowed either conscience vote or I previously advocated free vote based principled evaluation arguments againstFor example evaluating the alliance argument conflict needs resolved national interests communal values prohibit sacrifice human life solely please friends future advantage In deciding whether stand party policy issue similar conflict arises individual members career interests personal duty decide issues behalf electorateMoral problems like resolved individual acts moral courage You cannot delegate conscience Such moral issues need confronted reference values profess live by interests others want advanceIn cases issues arise representatives Parliament need reminded duty enunciated Burke exercise judgment conscience For precisely trust place them But question is itScott MacInnes former lecturer lawyer mediator human
