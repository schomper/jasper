<Title>All for one and one for all: police fail the attitude test</Title>
<Contents>I close relative retired cop I respect admire greatly As former police reporter I love hearing stories time in job Well often trade yarns exceptionally stupid things exceptionally stupid people done It makes interesting evenings conversationMany stories  ones worth telling least   start police term the attitude testBasically youre polite police pass Youll treated respectfully fairly But youre smart ass fail Guess comes next The problem test rude actually criminal offenceTheres law sneering grunting police Equally theres nothing Crimes Act frowns upon someone bursting fits laughter Highway Patrolman wearing ridiculous mirrored sunglasses pops head window says Do know fast goingFundamentally comes common courtesy mutual respect Thats ideal course But variety reasons valid police arent always going get respect But doesnt give right apply law unevenlyIntroducing Kevin Spratt Aboriginal man knows little bit policingMr Spratt making headlines around world past days video footage emerged week West Australian Police tasering 13 times despite fact already police custody posing real threat His offence refuse submit strip searchVideo footage  2008   shows Mr Spratt surrounded police station nine officers One repeatedly tasers him eight times camera another five times camera At one point Mr Spratt  screaming apparent agony   seen trying crawl chairs protection At stage video appear lash policeIt is name pack assault perpetrators happen public servantsThe officers involved avoided excessive use force charges victim approach senior police convinced allow matter dealt internally Two senior constables subsequently fined 1200 750 At least one since promotedThe video makes pretty disturbing viewing As might expect gone viral internet reported around worldIts playing badly West Australian police least organisation already bad reputation WA example highest jailing rate Indigenous citizens anywhere earth Indeed jails black males rate eight times greater South Africa dying days ApartheidPolice obviously play pretty key part thatA day Spratt video released man Sydney killed taser rushed police armed two knives Only two days earlier another Sydney man died arrestIt week police conduct  point alleged misconduct  squarely public eyeMedia keep linking events involve police arrests In fact incidents poles apart comparedThere vast difference example tasering man armed two knives rushing police tasering unarmed man already custody lying floor posing threat surrounded copsOne reasonable act The criminal offence And its simply wrong argue tasers banned basis misuse police We dont ban cars drunks occasionally get behind wheelPolice assault citizens   officers stand watch happen   simply charged criminal offence dealt full force law It ridiculous suggest otherwise Although its ridiculous offering emerged course debate reported FairfaxThe West Australian Corruption Crime Commission come blasted officers could done investigation declined theyve come released video slammed WA police it said WA Police Union president Russell Armstrong Im amazed I think theyre trying justify existenceAt time West Australian police needed real leadership head union walked media gaze promptly stuck head arse behalf members West Australian Police Service And bear mind folks police union presidents elected positions Armstrong politicianHes also helpfully problem solver Because inadvertently hes helped identify real problem here concern police break law The problem  case many others   response police breaking lawEight officers stood around watched thug badge uniform assault unarmed man They nothing stop him In fact presence  silence   aided criminal endeavourHaving assaulted man caught senior police approach victim talk pressing chargesEveryone involved lose badgeWhile CCC investigation note alarming increase number tasers used Aboriginal people problem restricted WA All nation frequent reports police abusing powersNowhere startling case Queensland home far disgraceful episode Australian policing history or least disgraceful one know aboutI am course referring death custody Mulrunji DoomadgeeIn November 2004 Mulrunji aged 36 walking home night out He known local police widely regarded happy go lucky member Palm Island Aboriginal communityAs passed police arresting another man domestic violence offence chipped black community police officer part oppressing peopleMulrunji warned move on immediately But Snr Sgt Chris Hurley  man affecting arrest biggest cop island standing two metres tall weighing 115kg  decided Mulrunji nicked regardlessMulrunji seems failed attitude testWithin hour lying dead floor Palm Island watchhouse His liver split two spleen ruptured four ribs broken hed suffered abrasions scalp faceIts emerged subsequent inquiries Hurley assaulted Aboriginal people months leading killing including woman named Barbara Pilot Ms Pilot run Hurley but helpfully investigating police found incident never actually occurred Ms Pilot airlifted island shin bone sticking skin apparently made entire incident upThe investigating officer turned Hurleys close friend neighbour He officer appointed investigate killing Mulrunji months later He found fault part Hurley case either since promotedIve seen pretty disturbing images associated death Mulrunji one sticks photo came year death custodyIts room full 1000 police raising hands support Hurley Police Union called snap rally protesting deemed government interference investigation actions policeOf course Queensland Force bigger one thousand men women This makes things worse Because date one man   Col Dillon highest ranking black policeman retired Australia man quit job Queensland government protest handling Doomadgee case  courage stand publicly criticise colleagues incidentDillon retired means 10500 police every single one stayed silentThe term endemic doesnt even begin describe problems Queensland PoliceTo day course Police Union never conceded milligram police misconduct despite repeated negative findings Crime  Misconduct Commission Indeed spent days feigning outrage suggestion police officer anything wrong Just like Union WASo beat itThe problems police culture lot like problems racism Australia The people problem dont acknowledge actually problem They think everyone else problemBut things inevitably blow evidence overwhelms theyre armed ready 100 excusesIn situations like this Cops cry foul ask How would like deal obnoxious drunks every day Truth told I wouldnt Thats Im cop Or taxi driver Or nurse Or paramedic Or bus driver Or security guard Or publicanAnd therein lies another point police dont monopoly dealing belligerent peopleWhat power arrest And guns And tasers And batons And capsicum spray And dogs And horses In short 1000 ways hurt you unfortunately many use them oftenPolice also say You dont understand its like police officerMaybe dont But heres something police dont seem understand Cops dont know feels like humiliated made feel powerless goon badge whos bad dayWhen negative experience with example shop assistant power balance essentially same Neither real great advantage Its clash youll likely remember rest life But negative experience police officer sticks power balance least time appears wildly cops favourIts worse course youre black I literally know single Aboriginal person either assaulted police related someone has Either every Aboriginal person I know liar exaggerator police cultural problem I know likelyThe greatest irony course many Australian population tend view police precisely police tend view Aboriginal people single subset behave wayAll cops bad cops badAll cops corrupt cops corruptAll cops arrogant cop arrogant meThe irony shouldnt lost police Nor fact supporting corrupt cops  regardless theyve done  makes every cops job much harderIn time journalist Ive seen police extraordinarily brave things Ive seen face incredibly stressful situations Ive seen weep openly terrible tragedies Ive seen try comfort families road crash victimsIve inspired acts police bravery kindness And I absolutely illusions job policing difficult one indeed job police professionally timeBut time We slip We transgress Its police do consequences much greaterPretending thats case wont fix anything Nor adopting siege mentality  police unions routinely   police indiscretions become public though admission error weakens entire police forceThe opposite true Police need start speaking up You cant fix problem dont admit existsIm attitude test I think applied internally little frequentlyChris Graham Walkley Award winning journalist former founding editor National Indigenous Times </Contents>
