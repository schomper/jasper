<Title>No climate change alternatives</Title>
<Contents>Just two weeks ago mother surgically separated Siamese twins Trishna Krishna enjoyed emotional reunion daughters  first since Melbournes medical scientists won uphill surgical battle late last year separated Trishna Krishna 32 hour marathon operation However notwithstanding joyous reunion operation partial success Like rest humanity Trishna Krishna still Siamese twins  are All us like not share planet alternative accommodation sight within galaxy We Siamese twins You me ugly cousin Barney guy next door hate loud music deserve called music I cant stand non music either Yes Siamese twins And no surgery option In instances matters little confidently ignore rest humanity pursuing solutions issues ranging internet censorship subsidies pork insemination industry Alas approach breaks comes climate change Like not countries decisions carbon emissions affect welfare decisions affect others We Siamese twins planet alternative accommodation sight within galaxy How then respond climate change If uncertainty climate change many media argued wise embark measures cut emissions Or relax nothing adapt changing climate This impasse easily resolved Just analyze weigh risks associated business as usual undertaking steps cut emissions Suppose continue business as usual That option sounds quite attractive first glance I enjoy new 4WD Mark Webbers latest Grand Prix victory like bloke So fiddle good thing actually quite comfortable Unfortunately considered closely option appears flaws One flaws since 1970s every decade hotter preceding one Another flaw sea levels rising least quickly predicted IPCC Lest think cosmetic problems resolved building better retaining walls recent Nature study showed oceans phytoplankton declined 40 since 1950s owing climate change Why care Because plankton forms foundation bountiful marine food chain produce half worlds oxygen suck CO 2 without plankton fish n chips tuna sandwiches Satellite pictures show Arctic ice melting faster even pessimistic forecasts anticipated years ago And 400 442 glaciers monitored worldwide retreating rapid rate thus eventually threatening drinking water supplies millions people Oops A recent peer reviewed study showed every extra degree temperature given year increases likelihood civil conflict Africa 50 Scientists predict additional human toll 390000 battle fatalities Africa 2030 climate change Anyone favours sit back adapt solution thus risk hundreds thousands fatalities among Siamese twins And lest think its Africans risk think again There every probability drought Murray Darling basin linked climate change Maybe something then But isnt transition fossil fuel economy clean energy economy scary Wont cost much Yes transition scary especially fossil fuel industry But transition also exciting rewarding Remember information revolution started 1980s Fast exhilarating wild ride befuddling us lot fun too Who wouldnt prefer Linux Matlab FORTRAN IV punched cards And would really want without internet Facebook Like really want write letters hand lick stamps tell friends party Do want go back days payphones always required one coin pocket would rather whip mobile What typing pools offered employment 1950s 1960s squeezing 50 young women noisy room clunky mechanical typewriters Do really want jobs back No course not And precisely way one bemoan departure noisy dirty dangerous jobs coal industry transition other cleaner sources energy completed The situation this In one corner scientists world overwhelmingly support consensus humans responsible climate change Although irresponsible media organs country seemingly best mislead thinking otherwise real scientific debate climate change Just months ago US National Academy Sciences stated unequivocally that Some scientific conclusions  thoroughly examined  likelihood   wrong vanishingly small Such conclusions   regarded  facts This case conclusion Earth  warming much warming likely due human activities Not surprisingly therefore peer reviewed analyses reveal time 95 expert climate scientists agree human CO 2 emissions contribute climate change Those scientists way vested interest matter salaries affected anything climate does trying preserve childrens well being  reward transition clean energy economy Its reward recent CSIRO study indicated 3 million jobs could created Australia 20 year transition low carbon economy putting rest irresponsible ignorant alarmism politicians falsely link action climate change economic decline Lest think thats optimistic bear mind China invested US346 billion renewables Denmark cut carbon emissions 21 1990 2006 time increasing GDP whopping 44 Germany reduced carbon emissions 28 whilst increasing GDP 32 creating 300000 clean energy jobs time Oh 6 speed 4WD grunt neighbours BMW produces 30 less CO 2 typical Australian family sedan Lest think thats modest reduction Germany latest green VW spews 70 less CO 2 Australian family sedan  topping 170 kmh autobahn So cutting emissions petrol headed fun In nutshell scientists wrong however unlikely is still get clean energy economy fun cars reduced emissions Oh corner junk science talking heads media dolts whose conspiracy theories debunked mouse clicks They teensy tiny chance right I very very generous If right miss clean energy jobs already created enlightened countries continue bear health costs unnecessary pollution And wrong every serious scientist says are kids children never forgive us wrecking planet borrowed them Its no brainer really Stephan Lewandowsky Winthrop Professor
