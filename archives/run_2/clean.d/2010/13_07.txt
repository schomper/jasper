<Title>Gillard's vision: moving forward together</Title>
<Contents>If doubt pragmatic centrist consensus building Prime Minister progressive leftie heart read   address Per Captia think tank features political rhetoric progressivism conservatism indicated convenience Im honoured today proud product Adelaide home first time city childhood Prime Minister I call Melbourne home   hopefully election Canberra   Adelaide special place heart always will This weekend I saw mother father person first time since becoming Prime Minister It special moment  A bit humanity injected speech front reminds us superhuman super human Flag political rhetoric A moment especially savoured coming day I shared time Palmer family mourned loss son Scott brave soldier Our objective Afghanistan clear combat threat terrorism   prevent Afghanistan becoming safe haven training ground terrorists launch attacks us allies The Australian Government Australian Defence Forces absolutely committed maximising protection men women serving overseas But doubt war Afghanistan dangerous may see Australian casualties Progress hard won take time Across Australia Adelaide need maintain resolve  A clean segue issue topical import nod gravity Australian sacrifice appeal resolve straight back positioning main thrust speech Flag political rhetoric Adelaide part I am I grew up went school took first steps work university adulthood here Whether its memories fruit trees back yard playing Brown Hill Creek taught knit elderly women lived Sunset Lodge mother worked favourite teacher Mr Crowe correct grammar primary school recollections place people good I arrived here aged four guest generous nation This country city along parents sister teachers friends formed outlook character philosophy political purpose  Note reference environmental factors shaped philosophy outlook   classic progressive appeal external causes belief behaviour rather internal causes like instinct inspiration traditionally conservative line Flag progressive values Today I want use occasion tell little I came moment time beliefs I intend put practice Prime Minister I mentioned parents now Many feel like know well given recently become TV stars Indeed I meet people around country literally say Im sure yet I love parents Im standing today brave decision made 1966 migrate Australia Originally bound Melbourne met befriended Welsh couple board ship brought us Australia Knowing no one else Australia made sense settle Adelaide home town new friends became Uncle Frank Aunty Glad My parents story important millions others helped make country today It wasnt easy leave little Welsh town behind wasnt easy people countries like Greece Italy Vietnam same arrive Pennington Migrant Hostel without family friends greet carry suitcases car Being British easier others They spoke English   although I guess could say strange accent Some say daughter still speaks strange accent But without higher education obtaining even moderate level prosperity involved lot hard work For mother meant cooking scrubbing pots Salvation Army aged care home And father meant demanding work frequent nightshifts nurse psychiatric hospital Their experience instilled clear beliefs importance value work I hold day  First mention hard work typically conservative thing emphasise along implied notions personal responsibility self determination Yet Gillard places progressive spin directing work towards accumulation wealth status towards welfare others Flag conservative values with progressive tilt As daughter two fine people I know its like dad work two jobs mum work afternoon shift buy home educate kids My fathers two jobs helped secure two university degrees Ill never forget sacrifices mother made And I say parents thing   whether its pay mortgage bills school fees expenses   I understand sacrifices I best Prime Minister ease burden  Beyond fairly blatant appeal Rudd would called working families or Beazleys passive voiced middle Australia hint Gillards vision role government shape environment ease burden citizens classically progressive idea Flag progressive values and whiff political expedience My parents thrived egalitarian country larrikin embrace informality egalitarian instinct They embraced sense opportunity community found Australia sense future possibilities children Australia clearly offered them They always taught everyone equal worthy respect Its wrong view better person waits restaurant Its wrong believe defer anyone simply dint title occupation background different own  Hard miss repetition egalitarian signature progressive value context means fairness much means anti authoritarian counter dominance Some conservatives hand feel work harder deserve more genuinely highly valued revered Flag progressive values I shy child nurture family found sense self face world confidence look others eye greet firm shake hand  The word nurture significant progressives particularly relation family metaphor choice government like nurturant parent loves protects encourages children building environment allow flourish people need flourish opportunity so Conservatives hand tend towards strict father metaphor father instils values self determination self discipline children survive flourish hostile competitive world people need flourish enterprise discipline measure ruthlessness Flag progressive values Though parents never chance go university day avid readers father given quoting poetry dinner table We hear lot today commentators Australians sliced diced separate tribes different values tastes ambitions based long stayed education live Those commentators divide us elites aspirationals rednecks presume predict views way vote Driven family background I consider insult I know every roof people love going art galleries people love going MCG people love both people go church people go protests people one day people whose talents lie heads people whose talents lie hands people rely different talents different stages lives  Reminiscent Barak Obamas 2004 Democratic National Congress speech   know one goes the pundits like slice and dice country Red States Blue States Well I say tonight theres liberal America conservative America theres United States America Its essentially appeal pluralism tolerance two trademark progressive values Flag progressive values with touch political rhetoric Its true ignorant intolerant people every society overwhelming majority Australians far thoughtful tolerant compassionate critics imagine  The language interesting Note Gillard doesnt declare ignorant intolerant people Australia directly softens claim suggesting theyre every society The usage tolerant compassionate another progressive telltale Then theres dismissal unnamed faceless critics forming us and them division values anyone disagrees them Flag progressive values with touch political rhetoric I know neighbours friends As I said last week were better cynics believe us be Were elites aspirationals rednecks Were simply Australians proud it  This appears attempt appropriate notion Australian pride progressive sense express positive sentiments Australia express negative sentiments others Flag progressive values So slow judge stereotype other  Yet moves descriptive praise Australians tolerance prescriptive advice should tolerant Flag progressive values My parents would put far simply   would say dont judge book cover Plain speaking another one virtues I strive maintain You might say that along apprenticeship straight talking I inherited two unshakeable beliefs upbringing  Plain speaking straight talking ways saying anti elite although Gillards case might genuinely mean plain speaking Flag progressive values First I believe importance hard work obligation owe others earn keep best Life given direction purpose work Without work corrosive aimlessness With loss work comes loss dignity  Return work somewhat bold claim life given direction purpose work Karl Marx would heartily agree As would many conservatives ironically enough Flag verging Marxist values Second I believe transformative power education Education route opportunity self improvement todays Australia ever With parents support encouragement I attended local schools excellent schools South Australia They places I discovered love learning enthusiasm correct grammar punctuation respect discipline even liking school uniform I think I still prefects tie day Whatever else young people may encounter life sound foundation excellent rigorous education ought entitlement  Back core progressive beliefs namely education luxury afford it right This external world   experience education community luck etc   play leading role directing lives according progressive worldview Conservatives hand tend value strength character desire reward success   even success parents afford private education Flag progressive values These beliefs inheritance How I pursued throughout adult life responsibility Moving Unley High School University Adelaide open new world me In heady days campus life university politics I began journey It taken different paths different destinations parents But driven values aspirations Where parents put working effort lives moving family forward efforts become focused efforts move country forward  The beginning forward section In fact word forward appears nearly often Australia twice less often work Progressives virtually definition believe benefits change conservatives suspicious change Moving forward essentially synonym encouraging change reinforcing Gillards old school progressive values Flag progressive values My sister Alison chose path devoting care skill mother As career developed   starting student union movement years lawyer time Parliament   I increasingly became activist optimist I became someone believes tomorrow better today strive make so And attitude matured me found expression commitment even passion public service Australias history contains great moments unrepeatable achievements But stop us looking forward positive obligation make future even brighter past We proud past And confident moving forward The best way strengthen confidence reduce fear anxiety recognise need change take deliberate steps forward together  Its actually little uncharacteristic progressive   although apparently core Gillards brand politicking   give nod conservative concerns particular fear anxiety change Stressing need change might sway many conservatives terms like deliberate steps line conservative approach cautious change rather radicalism Flag progressive values and touch bi partisan political rhetoric And so I come childhood home I reminded core many Australias problems opportunities today fundamental choice It really variant age old question every nation faced whether resist change master it whether condemn new ways thinking welcome them whether defend way things are declare we better In simplest terms choice whether move forward back  Textbook false dichotomy fallacy spectrum choices metaphorically moving forward back Flag fallacy I passionately believe core Australians instinct move forward   summon courage think plans shape future Going back simply inconsistent Australian character  Characterising Australia progressive isnt necessarily going convince many conservatives good ol days werent good Flag fallacy We people descended overwhelmingly newcomers people lived settled rugged land people constantly embraced innovation order build modern farms cities Australia built people sat still closed eyes shied away new terrain We people nourished ambitions diet nostalgia indifference denial My life rooted sense forward motion core nations story It reflects underlying promise see many Australian life stories work hard play rules treat others respect best contribute move forward important nation move forward  Note hard work isnt conservative notion work personal wealth work aid entire nation individual endeavour collective good   closet Marxism Flag progressive Marxist values As Prime Minister I intend start lead discussions debates must shape future better I speak plainly challenges truthfully risks methodically steps need take As I said first day Prime Minister days I delight days I disappoint you But every day I working hardest you Some challenges face nation daunting They take long time overcome  Were nearing end tempering words difficulty task ahead order Flag political rhetoric That I believe that alongside practical action necessary must make effort honest conversation bring people us make clear actually order get things right In days come I putting forward detailed arguments biggest challenges facing nation I explaining steps I think need take asking peoples consideration steps I ask Australian peoples trust move Australia forward Without listening respectfully publics views I believe possible politicians earn hold trust people elect us Leadership requires listening persuading understanding bold action  A cynical listener might remain unconvinced Gillard Labor party embody kind courageous leadership dares persuade people view dont already hold rather polling exhaustion following mob Flag political rhetoric As I said challenges daunting But overwhelming sense coming job one optimism Optimism already achieved people made Australia today Optimism capacity decency millions Australians contribute way without thanks praise making better place  The repetition optimism accident one key differentiators progressive conservative outlooks former generally optimistic human nature world latter generally sees human nature bad nature hostile Flag progressive values Australia wonderful country greatest country earth We fear future The best days nation lie front us behind us  A final rhetorical flourish reminiscent of oh almost every politician speaking prospects nation term government Flag political rhetoric We privileged live best respect great privilege working together shaping better future going forward back Thank much  Overall laced subtle reference contemporary progressive values   optimism equality right education nurturant family worldview responsibility others community etc   nod conservative values work personal responsibility although still clearly tilting left right Although overall speech likely intended ground Gillard typical if perhaps exceptional working Australian values fair go trademark Aussie larrikinism straight talks   ie Kevin Rudd John Howard One notable feature Gillards rhetoric also acknowledgement conservative perspectives even argues them Its all too easy dismiss side wrongheaded ensuing argument tends change minds By least acknowledging others feel differently Gillard hopes engage them turn opinion Whether itll work not well thats yet seen Didnt work well Obama Tim Dean science journalist philosophy PhD student </Contents>
