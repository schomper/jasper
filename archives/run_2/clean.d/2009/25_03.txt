<Title>Crazy for Costello</Title>
<Contents>Why media fascination Peter Costello Why obsession virtually everything former treasurer says days   guest appearances QA Lateline ABC morning walks around Parliament House facial expressions Question Time According conventional wisdom Costellos alleged leadership ambitions destabilising influence Opposition account constant public interest John Howards former heir apparent Todays Newspoll showing Costello preferred opposition leader Malcom Turnbull merely confirms interest But I suspect factors work For one thing hes larger than life personality At time Question Time devoid colourful characters even Labor partisans would concede towering 6ft 3inch Costello rates high great parliamentary performers post war era   Robert Menzies Jim Killen Coalition side Gough Whitlam Paul Keating ALP side As Barry Cohen former Labor minister acknowledged Not hilariously funny   immensely valuable asset things tense Parliament   great sense theatre full flight rally troops depths depression It said politics show business ugly people veteran Canberra journalist Laurie Oakes recently said Costello knows the best way get attention voters interest entertain   bore silly Whatever one thinks politics Costello anything boring Bear mind next time see Prime Minister Tony Abbott recently called a toxic bore dominate Question Time Another reason Costello occupies hearts minds really care policy direction party nation In recent weeks criticised Governments 42 billion fiscal stimulus package well plans implement carbon pollution reduction scheme beef union power workplace On occasion Member Higgins helped encourage shadow cabinet support conservative positions On emissions trading justified opposition grounds would cost jobs lower growth raise energy prices export energy intensive industries China India On industrial relations called amendments Labors plan restore union power levels seen since 1980s move part electoral mandate And stimulus package said big requiring much debt pay it also mushy weak form stimulus relying old style Keynesian pumping priming Labor party pet projects instead income tax cuts actually change incentives work invest It soon tell whether right point taking issues seriously enough argue case publicly privately forcefully coherently So much commentators suggest Costello driving Oppositions policy agenda To extent true healthy reminder that Westminster system policy still sometimes derive parliament executive backbenchers represent constituents branches play significant role nations law making process When I made point Lateline Friday night host Leigh Sales countered Costellos behaviour likely related possible leadership ambitions Perhaps But point former treasurer and so called militants Liberal party room merely contributing parliament opposition policy making What odd that And yet Member Higgins cant win When Costello relatively quiet backbench throughout last year journalists such Sun Heralds Kerri Anne Walsh complained hindered Liberal party leave parliament When speaking contributing policy recent weeks however journalists insist still hinders Liberal party leave parliament In words Costello damned damned doesnt Which brings third final reason Costello attracts much attention presence parliament reminder good times John Howard presided March 1996 November 2007 With unemployment rising national debt budget deficit increasing economy descending serious recession wonder Labor polling research according journalist Peter Hartcher shows nostalgia among focus groups Costello Sure dozen years treasurer coincided bullish economic cycle fueled part commodities boom Still reasoning much praise little criticise terms actually done Costellos watch There also lot said economic narrative He senior political figure Australia predicted global financial crisis year Wall Streets crash On least half dozen occasions US sub prime mortgage collapse September 2007 federal election two months later then treasurer warned sub prime crisis would create problems around world In late October forecast huge tsunami would roll financial markets sub prime home lending debacle ran course United States The collapse sub prime US lending market said Coalitions campaign launch November 12 is reverberations around world At time several Labor activists media commentators took issue Costellos warnings financial tsunami claiming running scare campaign Coalitions economic arguments re election increasingly incoherent But far incoherent Costello intellectually consistent since read national global economic landscape better parliamentarian When Labor calling tighter fiscal monetary policy   read big spending cuts higher interest rates   contain imaginary inflation dragon Costello calling looser fiscal monetary policy   read big tax cuts lower interest rates   protect Australia global recession So thats case Costello arouses much interest He possesses something indefinable rare quality leadership Romans called gravitas commands policy substance compelling economic narrative Whether Costello turns leadership bid remains seen But least explains constant source public interest scrutiny
