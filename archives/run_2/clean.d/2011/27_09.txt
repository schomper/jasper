<Title>A comedy in search of a situation</Title>
<Contents>Although episode three pretty much worked unlike others partly many vivid characters Keating Abbott Rudd Julie Bishop tender emotional line he thinks theyre getting engaged misheard said fixing government job end I realised trouble was The dog Bill Shorten peed Julias leg bent over big bum towards audience cleaning urine puddle alone Lodge sighing bit I realised genre stab genre hadnt previously existed For wasnt situation comedy like Spin City Just Shoot Me Frasier since characters genre always fictional And wasnt satirical comedy like Yes Minister The Thick Of It In The Loop Dave characters genre always fictional It wasnt long run political drama like The West Wing House Of Cards goofy jokes people genre fictional too It wasnt historical drama like Rome Deadwood The Borgias events didnt parallel really happened could happened The Prime Minister Lodges cook She never drives car She doesnt pet dog She doesnt sex office full people Nor resemble original inspiration it various Wharf Revue sketches Gillard Rudd Keating danced sang recapitulations The Sound Of Music The Wizard Of Oz Howard Janette Costello Abbott revisited Downfall Hitler bunker film It none cartoon like Bugs Bunnyish levity though Bigginss much loved Keating trickled it trickled down might say Nor like Max Gilliess famed stage monologues Howard Hawke Robert Hughes Germaine Greer me It none suspenseful gob smacked pleasure theatre performance happening flesh eyes recognisable tics victims paraded illuminated celebrated Nor like Mike Carltons radio sketches aural 60 second comic strips recent events Nor like Patrick Cook column Bill Leak cartoon Paul Keating interview crackling one liners It precedent trouble What try impose concept like I Love Lucy Kath And Kim sitting Prime Minister live in lover without heed way actually behave amuse themselves The Thick Of It instance show reproduced political backroom I served 16 years startling accuracy penetrating foul mouthed hilarity Yes Minister instance Bob Hawke told me spot on Each series showed verisimilitude hindrance well written comedy Why then pretend Prime Ministers life is There assistants harassing every turn She chief staff media manager chef butler driver ministry worried deputy distracting hourly crises unremitting work schedule soldiers funerals attend She doorstops rehearse big speeches learn Question Time get through prepare for She busy So retirement village idleness see First Bloke in In chapter universe reside Why call Julia Gillard Tim Mathieson all Why call Jane Billings Tom Matthews There arises question privacy Tim separated husband children elsewhere living sort gilded adultery nations embattled ruler underemployed constitutionally anomalous Does deserve demeaning untruths however cuddlesome first seem told too also public figure I doubt it A line somehow limits genre crossed crossed Philip Ruddock might say inappropriately Let us imagine series Cheryl Kernot Gareth Evans difficulties adultery humanistically portrayed and show comically diminished Leaders different parties meeting motels discussing national policy undressing A line would crossed too wouldnt it It might work drama series made 2025 comedy never I portrayed satirically Gillies Gerry Connolly Drew Forsythe Robin Ramsey untidy lecherous opinionated gravy spattered highfalutin buffoon always respectable level intellectual attack Ive winced never minded it returned rule theatre seen again If however wife sketch venomously adverted Bob Ellis fabricated stage figure she I think less public figure would rightly upset would I partner 45 years children This then roughly equates present uneasy situation Tim Mathieson seen National Headlice Awareness Coordinator episode three hoping announce engagement Julia Im sure deserved this although I laughed good bit forlorn comeuppance did I guess nation unfairly instances And yes I admired Phil Lloyds performance He turned meek Graeme Blundellish fish out of water bumbler somehow dignified somehow admirable human being I admired performances Rudd Keating gay disdainful assistant jewellery store Amandas additional cross eyed drunken turn Julie Bishop This brings us Amanda herself effective auteur played Marilyn Monroe I co wrote staged reading well audience sat amazed She may best revue actress hemisphere millennium may also I think evidence in
