thats end matter better proud people tough unpopular incumbents admit wrong cop consequences wounded leader Theres that Both Rudd Turnbull have shall say solid reputations faith judgment abilities They less solid reputations open approachable matters already chosen view If either man would return leadership party would naturally free rein please This would mean old faults would come fore remind
