<Title>Climate science and James Hansen misrepresented</Title>
<Contents>Recently climate sceptics Anthony Cox David Stockwell published opinion piece The Drum claiming climate scientist James Hansen admitted climate models wrong human caused global warming therefore doubtThe article contains basic misrepresentations Hansen substance implications draft paper HansenThe Hansen paper weaken case humans main cause global warming On contrary suggests unwittingly temporarily shielded full effects activitiesProfessor James Hansen NASA Goddard Institute Space Studies recently 18 April posted draft scientific paper comment The paper argues computer models climate over estimated rate heat absorbed oceans Because trade off models heat entering oceans heat reflected back space aerosols atmosphere implication cooling effect aerosols under estimatedThis good news implies aerosols partially shielding us full warming effects carbon dioxide emissions As aerosol pollution cleaned up global warming get worseThe Cox Stockwell commentary misrepresents Hansens role intention posting draft paper It uses prejudicial language It claims Hansen merely assumed warming effect greenhouse gases known fact Hansen clearly spelt independent evidence thisThe commentary begins claiming Hansen published draft paper free restraints peer review personal web site implying Hansen engaging sly trick In fact Hansen quite clear paper draft critical comment welcome Posting publishingThe commentary characterises Hansen the worlds prominent expert use computer models understanding Earths climate gives impression Hansen great believer accuracy computer models In fact Hansens group one main computer modelling groups Hansen quite clear book Storms Grandchildren computer models useful tool improve understanding exclusively relied uponCox Stockwell repeatedly characterise Hansen paper frank admission concession climate models significant inaccuracy In fact Hansen normal science He trying improve understanding climate improve accuracy climate models All climate modellers know inaccuracies poorly constrained factors models There conspiracy exaggerate models accuracy nothing admitted Nor implication case human caused global warming weakened more laterCox Stockwell erroneously characterise principal conclusion Hansen paper say models inaccuracy has effect exaggerating net AGW anthropogenic global warming models AGW refers rise temperature the warming fact implication models exaggerated projected rise temperatureRather implication stated Hansen that models the corresponding net human made climate forcing unrealistically large emphasis added The forcing refers extra energy trapped atmosphere resulting temperature rise The two major human contributions energy budget carbon dioxide positive accurately known aerosols negative accurately known Hansen saying decades In models much heat energy absorbed oceans much aerosol cooling implied Hansen argues reality less heat going oceans aerosol cooling must larger net effect carbon dioxide warming effect minus aerosol cooling effect smallerMainstream scientists sceptics alike aware aerosol effect complex accurately known Hansen decades advocated dedicated satellite measure aerosol effects attempted past year launch failed Lacking direct measurements magnitude aerosol effect inferred energy terms accounted for The total energy implicitly constrained requiring models match observed temperature record past centuryIt widespread misconception evidently shared Cox Stockwell case human caused global warming rests mainly computer models therefore vulnerable aerosol uncertainty This misconception part disinformation put professional deniers funded likes ExxonMobilIn fact Hansens main argument based paleoclimate records records past climate variations extracted ice rocks Cox Stockwell would know properly read Hansens book recent paper also listed Hansens web site Paleoclimate Implications Human Made Climate Change January 18During ice ages global mean temperature rose fell 5 degrees Celsius every hundred thousand years so The measured variations temperature atmospheric carbon dioxide ice ages accurately constrain so called climate sensitivity 3 degrees per doubling carbon dioxide plus minus 03 degrees Because number based natural experiment accounts many complicated subsidiary effects feedbacks changes water vapour methane content atmosphere changes cloud cover accompany changes temperatureA side issue another widespread misconception carbon dioxide cannot causing global warming ice ages temperature changes occurred several hundred years carbon dioxide changed The reason well understood widely appreciated outside climate science communityDuring ice ages trigger temperature changes small changes heat received sun On would caused less degree temperature change temperature rises cause carbon dioxide released ocean soils greatly magnifies effect temperatures On hand present warming triggered human releases carbon dioxide variations suns heat carbon dioxide rise leading temperature rise rather lagging behind ice agesThus Cox Stockwell incorrect claim the effects CO2 feedbacks also unmeasured go propose another way bring energy balance might reduce presumed warming effect greenhouse gasses Rather warming due greenhouse gases carbon dioxide methane etc well constrained paleoclimate satellite laboratory measurements not I recounted here net energy forcing constrained observed temperature record past century includes significant warming past decades The conclusion human emissions causing recent warming remains strongThe recent paper Hansens mentioned above paleoclimate gives even reason concerned present situation Hansen notes couple past interglacial periods close present temperature which raised 06 degrees human causes sea level several metres higher present This implies present temperature maintained would suffer serious sea level rise probably next century soOf course temperature rise several degrees quickly change ways Paleoclimate records 3 million years ago show temperature 1 2 degrees Celsius higher sea level around 25 metres higher recent pre industrial levels A sea level rise magnitude occurring rates metres per century observed paleoclimate records would destroy many coastal cities much low lying land It would difficult rebuild maintain port infrastructure Along major changes climatic zones storms vegetation food water supplies hard see industrial civilisation could survive anything like present globally connected formThus Hansens recent work warns us seem much closer previously realised threshold global warming sea level rise run control world tip quite different climate regime This argues temperature rise limited 1 degree more 2 degrees commonly assumed politicians brought quickly possible This requires atmospheric carbon dioxide brought quickly possible present 390 parts per million 350 parts per million If aerosols limiting warming causing task even urgentThe writings climate sceptics typically betray patchy incomplete understanding climate science Cox Stockwell commentary exception This symptomatic tendency cherry pick science uncertainties hope discredit main conclusionsTheir poor scholarship society grave disservice Dr Geoff Davies retired geophysicist Visiting Fellow Australian National University </Contents>
