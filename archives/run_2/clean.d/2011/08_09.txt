<Title>At Home With Julia: inane drivel of the most idiotic kind</Title>
<Contents>There cant many people even masochistic Melbourne went watching numbing Bell Shakespeare production Julius Caesar experience looking At Home With Julia much dreaded but Truly Dreadful homage imperatrix Julius Caesar least Alex Menglets richly Russian Caesar and odds actor channelled ancient tradition Russian classical acting put rest cast shame Caesar alas killed half time Julia Gillard horrible TV homage unloveliness killed first five minutes reputation ABC producing firecracker political satire high level TV comedy You may think Julia Gillard hapless Australian Prime Minister since Billy McMahon You may think presided demise great political party nothing lean hungriness power believes nothing You may even think assassination Kevin Rudd little viability Labor Party Government Commonwealth simply that like Cassius could behold greater troops marched unlovable Kevin Rudd   well price knives conspiracy You may believe more That Julia Gillard really care carbon tax genuinely oppose gay marriage You may take dimmest possible view Prime Minister attempt ship children poor harried seekers refuge flogged desolated Malaysia the country hanged Barlow Chambers Australian drug dealers action Bob Hawke power described barbaric You may abhor way attacked Chief Justice High Court Australia rebuffed Malaysia solution resounding six one decision Even so taking dimmest possible view Julia Gillard deserve nation At Home With Julia inane drivel idiotic kind Had long planning would look like blatant attempt arouse compassion Prime Minister whose support fallen 25 per cent polls It sorry thing nation produced Barry Humphries provoked political satire Gillies Report gave harbour John Clarke could sink this Is land Edna Everage Kath Kym culture nurtured Magda Szubanski shrunk little measure Has Julia Gillards Australia sunk low expected laugh idiot rehearsal snobbery weird effect  lugubrious rubbery bad  making Prime Minister look comparison like Dame Maggie Smith height powers grace style flawless timing The first episode At Home With Julia revolved around Tim first dude cook dinner independents  Bob Katter Tony Windsor Rob Oakeshott  preference home grown ingredients by way mince tomatoes etc Julia preoccupied single minded political agenda pleasing everyone and mild misgiving willing usurp ruin date night despite fact shes get plane This threadbare situation comedy plotline fact sounds immeasurably promising hackneyed way fact ensues Amanda Bishops Julia  also wrote criminal script  rough though intricately accurate version Gillards terrible voice though much hammy vibrato little hesitation But dialogue ghastly beyond belief detail comic set would disgrace student revue So get Julia mixing designer beers serving fruitloops Tims home brooow Unable use wagyu beef which served small terrier Bill Shorten  wan ghostly gleam humour there ransacks rubbish bin last Octobers discarded chipolatas makes bolognaise sauce There ho ho scenes local kids simulate enviable laughter digs Lodges rubbish bin moonlight Is comic consequence  botulism fruitloop diarrhoea convulsively ghastly kind massacre newer gross comedy   young love sober middle aged parents fear loathe Nothing interesting We end up heavens sake Tim falling asleep exhaustion PM going deem quickie Its hard say whether At Home Julia open provocation revoke ABCs charter dire indictment current policy buying outsourced comedy I used think ABCs short lived cultural panel show The Vulture brainchild mercurial Renaissance man Guy Rundle   show alas I permanent panel member whole eight and a half weeks run  high claims considered worst bit television ABC ever put air Well At Home With Julia makes look like The Late Clive James John Freemans BBC interviews Nehru Evelyn Waugh It appalling television never gone air The idea making Julia Tim subject TV show bad start The kind political figures get away mawkishly softening lovable sitcom figures providing gentle hilarities political figures less vast objective glamour  Kennedys say Obamas Otherwise youre better sticking much safer territory outright political satire So At Home With Julia rooted and by category mistake first place Julia Gillard never figure film star like charisma Clintons or lesser way Blairs maybe Keatings She occupies funny place pantheon national mythology reach political Olympus She not still not I suspect widely loathed Hawke Howard Fraser Keating mention Rudd Abbott various stages We see her surface cartoon national mannerisms produce way nasal stridency also grave doubts lack deeper political conviction prowess But oddly enough perceive form personal frailty Can anyone tell Julia Gillard is There pathos plight political leader least looks hapless But At Home With Julia trite bit assassination flummery mess show oscillate feeling sympathy Prime Minister blaming bringing being At Home With Julia far less colour movement Julius Caesar I gave big florid Russian knocked off It not however compare well David Margaret shtick movies As happened talking Fred Schepisis splendid film The Eye Of The Storm Vince Colosimo Sigrid Thornton fine film Face To Face David Williamson script Yes ended discussion Ingmar Bergman masterpiece Cries And Whispers It enough make think ABC function Julia Gillards Australia capable butchering attempt comedy drama Peter
