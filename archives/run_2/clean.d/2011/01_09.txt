<Title>Malaysian solution: always a bad idea</Title>
<Contents>The High Court ruled yesterday Malaysian Solution lawful The majority decision turns nature Australias obligations Refugees Convention They held that Australia sends boat people away without considering claim protection receiving country offers protection Australia obliged offer The result entirely consistent spirit Refugees Convention designed spread burden refugee flows rather leaving borne countries adjacent trouble spots Leave aside politics it Malaysian Solution always bad idea We assume Australian Government intended treat 4000 refugees resettled Malaysia part offshore resettlement quota It presently offsets informal boat arrivals offshore resettlement quota Accordingly Malaysian arrangement neutral total refugee arrival rates So going reduce number refugees received Australia year going cost Australian taxpayer 200 million Weird economics Paradoxically arrangement may constituted significant pull factor least time The reason Malaysia allow refugees work The deal Malaysia would notionally allowed transferees work Refugees currently living Malaysia waiting resettlement would powerful incentive try get Australia order transferred back Malaysia receive work rights For person faces prospect waiting 15 years resettled incentive act way would strong If pull factor fact operated likely quota 800 transferees would filled pretty quickly would achieved little Australia apart adding significantly cost deterring boat arrivals If result Australia Malaysia increased quota arrangement cost would increased proportionally would pull factor So done now At present Australia system indefinite mandatory detention boat people The detention mandatory Migration Act requires non citizens without visa must detained must remain detention given visa removed Australia While Minister discretion mode detention detention remains mandatory even community detention falls far short actual freedom Detention indefinite fixed end point detention continues person receives visa which may take years removed Australia Removal Australia may happen years processing cases turns impossible   example person stateless Where person refused visa cannot removed Australia High Court decision al Kateb says may held detention rest life notwithstanding committed offence Changing policy attempt deter boat people seeking entry Australia rests several important assumptions The first fear Australia might exceeds fear fleeing That proposition quite implausible In past 15 years boat arrivals Afghan Hazaras fleeing Taliban Iraquis fleeing Saddam Hussein Iranians fleeing theocracy country Tamils fleeing genocide Sri Lanka Not surprisingly high percentage approximately 80 95 per cent boat people ultimately establish entitlement protection The second assumption asylum seekers wherewithal research treatment likely receive seek safety Australia There evidence suggest people desperate enough take risks associated unauthorised arrival Australia ever time resources investigate many changes Australias policy settings concerning asylum seekers The third assumption bound second people smugglers reliable source information passengers It highest degree unlikely people smugglers reveal candidly customers face mandatory detention removal Malaysia hardship government day seeks impose deterrent It therefore difficult assume anything done Australia make appreciable difference arrival rate boat people If things left are Australia continue face following problems associated present system needless infliction mental harm detainees damage Australias reputation nation cares human rights And dont forget huge cost mandatory detention costs us 1 billion year There simply merit idea detaining people indefinitely arrived Australia boat Asylum seekers also arrive air typically arrive short term visas business tourist student visas Once Australia apply asylum Once initial visa expires given bridging visa pending assessment claim asylum This may take years remain community happens Most asylum claims fail merits only 20 per cent succeed By contrast 80 90 per cent boat arrivals ultimately succeed claim asylum detained entire process The arrival rate asylum seekers come air two three times greater arrival rate boat people A question inevitably arises justification detaining boat people indefinitely vast expense ultimately succeed claim protection damaged less severely process To question seems genuine answer appeal political advantage There one interesting feature Malaysian deal Australia negotiated arrangement Malaysia involved minimal detention transferees released community work rights What cracking idea If Australia capped initial detention month health security checks overcrowding detention would solved instantly cost operating detention system would reduce dramatically foreseeable mental harm caused indefinite detention would stop It clear Australian Government thinks necessary desirable detain boat people indefinitely think necessary desirable Malaysia detain boat people except preliminary health security checks think necessary desirable detain asylum seekers come Australia plane The big question whether Government Opposition forget populism point scoring see way clear solving detention problem acting decently could save reputation taxes Julian Burnside AO QC Australian Barrister advocate human rights fair
