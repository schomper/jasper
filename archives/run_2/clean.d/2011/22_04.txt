<Title>The radical love of the Cross</Title>
<Contents>The Sunday Age last week front page story loss biblical literacy Australia especially amongst children The story lamented loss contained insightful comments including Prof John Carroll The story Good Friday resurrection floundering badly If lose tragic Jesus story culture lose lot That symbol cross sits top Western civilisation One could ask Western culture eviscerated central symbol largely given previously important way orienting ourselves understanding world Assoc Prof David Tacey Yet recognise loss Christian beliefs language symbols resulted free public secular space Those symbols beliefs replaced others taken place These symbols primarily based around nationalisms capitalism structure understand world interact other But care loss Christian symbols Are really helpful way Prof Carroll points that example losing Christian stories lost important way coming terms death To understand kind argument need understand Crucifixion Resurrection Jesus mean least broad sense The Cross often proclaimed sacrifice takes away sins It this much more Joseph Ratzinger now Pope Benedict XVI put terms In Bible cross appear part mechanism injured right contrary Bible cross quite reverse expression radical nature love gives completely process one one does one is expression life completely others  This truly something new something unheard   starting point Christian existence centre New Testament theology cross God wait guilty come reconciled goes meet reconciles them Here see true direction incarnation cross J Ratzinger Introduction Christianity San Francisco CA Ignatius Press 1990 p214 5 On Cross words see radical love comes meet humanity   God himself The Cross sacrifice angry deity sacrifice deity angry lost fractured humanity This meeting God humanity occurs place death humans inflicting worst kind violence hurt The power Christian message God love invades even worst kinds violence pain experiences utter abandonment alienation  things experience This message made powerful fact Creator   reason why anything rather nothing   becomes creature  makes vulnerable available us  takes worst kinds human experience God save us despairing death suffering  feel isolated  knowledge God present relationship us moments experiences As Gil Bailie puts it Jesus underwent God forsakenness even God forsaken would companion despair Our God God forsaken God The experience God forsakenness reclaimed Christ It Christian experience Along giving us human approach suffering Christianity also offers path hope As innocent forgiving victim God Jesus unites humanity humanity worst Despite humanity inflicting worst evils him God remains faithful humans order relate depths wounded condition hurt filled lives The power message whether one believes not God Creator lovingly seeks relationship humanity even death violence Thus always possibility us change forgiven enter relationship God others However important message Crucifixion Resurrection Jesus death end violence powerful force world overcome self sacrificial love This message shocking ancient world sounded ridiculous middle powerful empire world Gospel It wasnt conventional good news Gospel emperor which told conquests power grabs good news dictatorship violence death Gods love Far mythical tale Resurrection shows us meaning Crucifixion The message Resurrection death violence overcome love the Christian message basically nothing else transmission testimony love broken death thus transformed fundamentally situation us J Ratzinger Introduction Christianity p 234 This may still seem strange many and course message strange first appeared Roman Empire recognise grand claim Christianity making here giving historical existential proof love really stronger death violence Christianity making philosophical argument idle claim seeking give real substance claim power love In Western culture often hear romantic myths especially movies love powerful anything overcome all This originally Christian claim Yet Christians dont make claim idly like many films do Christians know claim substance death violence remain undefeated In words death wielding death violence seen ultimate end remain defining point human life power  cultures certainly Roman Empire  make realistic claim power love However Jesus really resurrected least basis claim love powerful force Even disciples Jews wanted Jesus wield death violence institute kingdom resisted Why Because trusted powerful force reveal death resurrection He trusted loving relationship God called Father Again one may readily accept Christian narrative it hard even Christians recognise power claimed deeply affected culture view world Though many may adhere Christian practice ways mainstream previously did perhaps appropriate re consider Christianity offer us personally culturally light Easter narrative really deal depths suffering death one offers way violence forgiveness and one offers real justification power love defeats violence death Creators inexhaustible love Joel Hodge lecturer Faculty Theology Philosophy Australian Catholic Universitys St Patricks campus Melbourne </Contents>
