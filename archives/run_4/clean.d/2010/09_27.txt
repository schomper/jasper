<Title>Spartacus no more</Title>
<Contents>last week end media  conference i blogging day ended panellist jason wilson asking who grogs gamut in response handful people stood announced im grogs gamut no im grogs gamut it response organised advance friends including wilson bit joke throughout day name grogs gamut mentioned times   point osman faruqi tweeting drink every time mentioned pretty well ear well longer need ask question today james massola the australian taken upon apparently knowing i greg jericho public interest head abc mark scott mentioned speech blog post attacking journalists coverage campaign specifically lack policy mentioned abc executive meeting the first example blogs twitter traffic halfway campaign abc executive met monday morning discussed weekend blog canberra public servant writing tag grogs gamut it lacerating critique journalists following candidates obsession transient matters political scandal day he met chorus praise support triggering barrage criticism campaign coverage so head abc took notice something i wrote anonymously journalism i need named i guess lesson want blog anonymously dont effectively whatever think massolas decision certainly decision preference i say known i since last november why decided reveal name given scotts speech delivered september  say no doubt reasons thinks valid the justification story actually came media editor yes bizarre i someone national daily needs justify outing if public servant blogging tweeting sometimes airing partisan political line deserve anonymity no journalists editors grant anonymity sources whistleblowers grogs gamut know greg jericho active participant public debate via twitter blog the abcs managing director mark scott cited grogs gamut criticism medias election coverage abc news meeting result adjusted strategy fair enough but influencing public debate particularly public servant publics right know it medias duty report take however want now massolas article firstly headline controversial political blogger unmasked federal public servant well unmasking public servant actually happened ago   fact massola wrote august  hobby writers keep pros toes a funny thing happened political blogosphere last week the mainstream media got serious self analysis critical post canberra public servant blogs name grogs gamut but oh well didnt write headline ill let pass keeper he writes mr jericho subject intrigue media  conference canberra last thursday embedded anonymous blogger wore name tag gave first name last he knows sat coincidence table conference late afternoon i noticed knew name i sent private message twitter letting know i table he talk day fact left session ended pity chatted fair bit twitter i interested meet stupidly i know given known name  months i concerned would as others conference i didnt journalists   people asked post event drinks time journalists left i grogs gamut i said i strangely none gave stuff real name heres fun bit massolas article at height insulation scandal engulfed peter garrett defended former minister writing garrett demoted good reason  garrett demoted despite one media opposition actually able explain exactly level intelligence wrong deemed bungled yep i certainly believed still how i come view by reading newspapers also reading publicly released reports insulation scheme coming opinion its opinion differs the australians i never access anything areas handled insulation program i knew much little anyone reads media he also quotes in comparison mr jericho wrote opposition climate spokesman greg hunt could write phd thesis environmental political cowardice opposition leader tony abbott master spin rooty hill leaders forum wasnt debate abbott able get away inordinate amount bullshit yep two opinions i disappointed hunt i big fan prior dumping support carbon price   i would liked see turnbull cross floor i actually think long term career would better served and yes i thought rooty hill format joke going last julia gillard brisbane need worry getting picked anything the format loaded advantage person going second but heres thing libs got line i would turned kept job i always done including i howard   apolitically massola cites aps values aps apolitical performing functions impartial professional manner damn straight and i   i performing functions heres public service commission says political views participating political activities it quite acceptable aps employees participate political activities part normal community affairs aps employees may become members hold office political party aps employees whether members political parties expected separate personal views policy issues performance official duties this important part professionalism impartiality aps employee where aps employee involved publicly promoting party views certain issues duties directly concerned advising directing implementation administration government policy issues potential conflicts interest  well id say tweeting blogging tony abbott community forum rooty hill fairly well smack middle normal community affairs  i member political party  i separate personal views  once i never written policy program i directly concerned advising directing implementation thereof even indirectly matter massola little analogy the revelation mr jerichos identity latest string anonymous authors unmasked belle de jour author diary london call girl   revealed brooke magnanti   writer helen demidenko author the hand signed paper subsequently revealed helen darville dale the australians christian kerr outed hillary bray contributor crikey nice im compared prostitute heres thing   belle de jour writing experience inside knowledge kerr hillary bray i i never offered information publicly known helen demidenko contrast pretending someone order work appear authentic had i saying i political insider staffer analogy would correct it at least massola quote saying asked concerned partisan political views appropriate role public service mr jericho said i never write anything i work either blog twitter so i thought easiest   given i want continue saying something opinion   go pseudonym ive worked public service liberal government labor government overseeing programs policy i really care i working   purely policy program paramount ive never difficulty working either side my supervisors never problem and im writing home dinner i comment issues nothing work look i know theres fair bit heat directed massola twitter but im pick fight i wish hadnt written piece no aint getting christmas card throughout last  months i twitter i often arguments journalists i would like think i never abusive i blocked one journalist i made snarky comment one saturday morning retweeted one followers yet i never attacked journalist blog   fact even defended comments i know many journalists twitter think massola right thing some less publicly debate away must my bugbear would nice provided links blog standard courtesy online so everyone least small care knows i so public interest served do words carry less weight yesterday i dont think i started blog back  i chose name grog nickname back days uni early due drinking ability due illegible handwriting made greg look like grog note i wrote friend i using grog posting poll bludger i actually quoted samantha maiden the oz  response bad newspoll quoted comments made poll bludger nervous lefties   comment actually tell everyone calm worry   unfortunately online anymore when i decided start blog i thought sensible keep

never viewed grog free pass write anything i wanted as said i never write area policy moment film except peripheral sense   ie movies i like odd promotion upcoming australian films i think looks interesting i never written anything i gleaned work all information i use comes media press releases public reports this pretty clear anyone regularly reads blog   never find breaking inside news   find opinion analysis i also never used advertising   despite quite friends work online saying im mad my view even i make pocket money writing partisan political commentary i would wrong i wrote piece the drum purely media coverage made political comment wish deeper policy sides ironically blog post got coverage included praising liberal party disability policy though i still dont know daughter would qualified i chose grogs gamut title blog title pieces stream consciousness guff i wrote boarding college paper time uni and blog continues ill keep using title name so well well see ill keep posted i hope i keep blogging even sport films books media geez theres ample material maybe media cant cope blog gets  readers day personally i think as the australians matthew franklin attest
