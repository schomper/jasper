dont acknowledge actually problem they think everyone else problembut things inevitably blow evidence overwhelms theyre armed ready  excusesin situations like cops cry foul ask how would like deal obnoxious drunks every day truth told i wouldnt thats im cop or taxi driver or nurse or paramedic or bus driver or security guard or publicanand therein lies another point police dont monopoly dealing belligerent peoplewhat power arrest and guns and tasers and batons and capsicum spray and dogs and horses in short  ways hurt unfortunately many use oftenpolice also say you dont understand like police officermaybe dont but heres something police dont seem understand cops dont know feels like humiliated made feel powerless goon badge whos bad daywhen negative experience example shop assistant power balance essentially neither real great advantage its clash youll likely remember rest life but negative experience police officer sticks power balance least time appears wildly cops favourits worse course youre black i literally know single aboriginal person either assaulted police related someone either every aboriginal person i know liar exaggerator police cultural problem i know likelythe greatest irony course many australian population tend view police precisely police tend view aboriginal people single subset behave wayall cops bad cops badall cops corrupt cops corruptall cops arrogant cop arrogant methe irony shouldnt lost police nor fact supporting corrupt cops  regardless theyve done  makes every cops job much harderin time journalist ive seen police extraordinarily brave things ive seen face incredibly stressful situations ive seen weep openly terrible tragedies ive seen try comfort families road crash victimsive inspired acts police bravery kindness and i absolutely illusions job policing difficult one indeed job police professionally timebut time we slip we transgress its police consequences much greaterpretending thats case wont fix anything nor adopting siege mentality  police unions routinely   police indiscretions become public though admission error weakens entire police forcethe opposite true police need start speaking you cant fix
