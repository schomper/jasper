troops combatants ever increasing number innocent civilians death suffering clearly much moral issue issue involving national interestsnormally would think issue involving killing human beings would call conscience vote this case debates past death penalty abortion stem cell research it also case debate euthanasiahowever neither major party permitted conscience vote debate war indeed vote even though involves matters life death affecting thousands people say matter there probably two reasons thisthe first preserving executives exclusive power decide issues relating war the second threat vote might pose party unitybecause realpolitik firmly entrenched pressure follow party line extreme becomes even important consider responsibility elected representatives challenge status quo grave moral issues arise this requires examination particular nature duties towards people elected themthere two competing views the popular view states members act accordance wishes electorate according view members merely delegates constituency entitled substitute personal judgments constituents their difficulty determining bound follow knowledge electorate targeted opinion polls essential requirements herethe better constitutional view however states member personal non delegable duty serve interests constituents necessarily reflect opinions wishes according view member like trustee

government would adopted burkes conservative principled view duty in end constituents nation got deserved best efforts elected representatives make minds make difficult choices behalf even disagreed for burke primary moral duty every elected representative parliamentwhile would obvious independents position far less clear members elected party representatives how classic theory members duty constituents qualified members duty party once two competing viewsthe first states elected member party party platform member duty bound delegate personal responsibility party the party decides member vote issues the concession issues party leadership member allows conscience vote very occasionally member cross floor issue disproportionately affects local electorate both exceptions suggest duty
