planet alternative accommodation sight within galaxy we siamese twins you ugly cousin barney guy next door hate loud music deserve called music i cant stand non music either yes siamese twins and surgery option in instances matters little confidently ignore rest humanity pursuing solutions issues ranging internet censorship subsidies pork insemination industry alas approach breaks comes climate change like countries decisions carbon emissions affect welfare decisions affect others we siamese twins planet alternative accommodation sight within galaxy how respond climate change if uncertainty climate change many media argued wise embark measures cut emissions or relax nothing adapt changing climate this impasse easily resolved just analyze weigh risks associated business usual undertaking steps cut emissions suppose continue business usual that option sounds quite attractive first glance i enjoy new wd mark webbers latest grand prix victory like bloke so fiddle good thing actually quite comfortable unfortunately considered closely option appears flaws one flaws since every decade hotter preceding one another flaw sea levels rising least quickly predicted ipcc lest think cosmetic problems resolved building better retaining walls recent nature study showed oceans phytoplankton declined  since owing climate change why care because plankton forms foundation bountiful marine food chain produce half worlds oxygen suck co  without plankton fish n chips tuna sandwiches satellite pictures show arctic ice melting faster even pessimistic forecasts anticipated

hundreds thousands fatalities among siamese twins and lest think africans risk think there every probability drought murray darling basin linked climate change maybe something but isnt transition fossil fuel economy clean energy economy scary wont cost much yes transition scary especially fossil fuel industry but transition also exciting rewarding remember information revolution started fast

typewriters do really want jobs back no course and precisely way one bemoan departure noisy dirty dangerous jobs coal industry transition cleaner sources energy completed the situation in one corner scientists world overwhelmingly support consensus humans responsible climate change although irresponsible media organs country seemingly best mislead thinking otherwise real scientific debate climate change just months ago us national academy sciences stated unequivocally some scientific conclusions  thoroughly examined  likelihood   wrong vanishingly small such conclusions   regarded  facts this case conclusion earth  warming much warming likely due human activities not surprisingly therefore peer reviewed analyses reveal time  expert climate scientists agree human co  emissions contribute climate change those scientists way vested interest matter salaries affected anything climate trying preserve childrens well  reward transition clean energy economy its reward recent csiro study indicated  million jobs could created australia  year transition low carbon economy putting rest irresponsible ignorant alarmism politicians falsely link action climate change economic decline lest think thats optimistic bear mind china invested us billion renewables denmark cut carbon emissions    time increasing gdp whopping  germany reduced carbon emissions  whilst increasing gdp  creating
