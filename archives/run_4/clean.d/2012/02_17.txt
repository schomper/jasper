<Title>Religion and politics: dangers of policy based on faith</Title>
<Contents>like mormon ex missionaries mitt romney knows best women i respect protect said  campaign massachusetts governor womans right choose unsurprisingly rhetoric last as conservative christian republican presidential candidate oppose womens control reproductive destiny this romney tried veto massachusetts law requiring religious hospitals provide contraception rape victims it critical obamas plan force religious institutions cover contraception employee insurance the white house initiative requires organisations like universities hospitals buy insurance workers contraception included alongside health services for democrat government chiefly health policy giving women power avoid unwanted unsafe pregnancy still enjoying consensual sex but conservatives like romney religious issue transgresses christians profound beliefs sanctity life romney campaigning colorado called violation conscience his colleague ohio republican john boehner called obamas legislation attack federal government religious freedom it typical stoush american politics issue reveals important religious mistakes it also suggests dangers policy based faith most obviously romneys outlook demonstrates steven jay goulds idea non overlapping magisteria noma neat in natural history essay gould argued science concerned empirical facts theories religion value including moral value might called ultimate value in keeping keen mind poetic pen gould noted the two magisteria bump right interdigitating wondrously complex ways along joint border but religion regularly makes claims physical world beginning universe origins life point human life begins it third concerns mitt romney contraception designed stop fertilised egg implanting uterus the contraceptive pill example for secular health professionals zygote fails implant full human life   human cells but romney fertilised egg living embryo absolutely supports legislation defines life beginning conception every action ive taken governor relates sanctity human life romney said interview conservative magazine human events i stood side life and behind sanctity particularly united states common humanism faith souls valuable divine origin this simply value facts nature universe nature human life this one case but makes point simplistic argue faith concerns value facts theories part religions authority comes claims world people divine origins necessitate flesh spirit if religion make claims would less worthwhile faithful less authoritative orienting sublime put another way magisterial overlap and many countries womens bodies stuck bump romneys outlook also demonstrates dangers democratic policy decided faith the president responsibility health americans regardless religion but evidence conservative policies like abstinence programs favoured many american republicans good focused sex education straightforward access contraceptives produce better public health outcomes along reduced social inequality if romney interested promoting best health outcomes fellow citizens would support laws provide good access birth control emergency contraception this might contradict professed beliefs would fully fulfil presidential duty instead romney putting religious purity one kind ahead american health and uncommon once begin metaphysical hypothesis   benevolent god created things example   takes little smuggle beliefs values supernatural cache this i described elsewhere metaphysical sleight hand these beliefs values unchallenged new evidence arguments pure sully empirical logical contradictions the selectivity sleight hand telling religious leaders including presidents united states happily contravene commandments like thou shalt kill they realpolitik pragmatists comes executing criminals but programs support womens control bodies attacked vehemence righteous defence conscience in short faith never wholly pure individual social biases selectively sanctified at worst religion politics psychological money launderer taking mucky notes prejudice cleaning ideals transcendent goodness presenting lawmakers legal tender women particularly disadvantaged usually end poorer this sleight hand suggests another problem romneys religious freedom one valuable achievements modern west indeed freedom worship understood legal protection religious belief a citizen free believe god fairies pasta deities without fear persecution discrimination however freedom often noted secular authors license curtail freedoms others we free see womans promiscuity careless ignoble empowering brave free restrict bodily liberty including sexual relationships consequences this liberal promise romney course also free depart promise worlds misogynistic muslim theocracies but important clear consequences departure the message romneys campaign simply faithful cannot govern well it atheists always make better politicians it particularly politicians religion rarely private consolation harmless theological speculation comforts counsel like missionaries men like romney seldom keep faith damon young australian philosopher writer author distraction view full profile </Contents>
