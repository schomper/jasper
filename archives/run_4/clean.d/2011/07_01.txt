<Title>The plausibility gap in the denial of climate change science </Title>
<Contents>for climate change sceptics denialists contrarians barry jones recently called confusionists right science climate change alternative reality must plausible logical firstly consensus amongst climate change scientists human activity significant contributing factor climate change must misguided best the  per cent active publishing climate scientists surveyed    per cent climate experts support consensus evidenced  study must wrong in addition joint science academies g countries statement climate change must also misguided must large number scientific bodies around world support consensus anthropogenic climate change part long list includes naasa american institute physics australia   csiro bureau meteorology europe european federation geologists royal society uk in alternative reality climate scientists exhibit impressive worldwide powers persuasion able mislead scientific peers decisively in alternative reality consensus climate science anyway irrelevant case climate science   language consensus language politics science   curiously half time consensus alternative reality important lists compiled demonstrate ostensibly large number scientists support consensus the expertise scientists important comes demonstrating opposition scientific consensus  geologists links mining fossil fuel industries valid climate scientists those inhabiting alternative reality cannot help notice actual scientific consensus quite compelling procure another explanation consensus exists malpractice stifling critics misuse peer review process the argument appears vast majority publishing climate scientists agree basic hypothesis anthropogenic climate change therefore demonstrates climate scientists following pack primarily want keep funding grants those scientists views contrary consensus therefore cannot get funding cannot published peer reviewed literature this narrative alternative reality becomes extremely illogical somewhere process science around world alternative reality presumes must inherent bias towards confirmation anthropogenic climate change that people somewhere government perhaps public funding institutions australian research council want see research confirms human causes climate change somehow people monopolise funding process secure outcome given climate research mostly conducted universities research institutes funded public purse means alternative reality governments right around world regardless ideology funded scientists decades reasons unknown affirm anthropogenic climate change this despite fact outcomes research conflict governments status quo economic interests energy systems transport systems in alternative reality governments around world conspired fund creation problem prove incapable solving why public research funding bodies countries us australia whose governments opposed action climate change early mid would time perverting independence scientific process directing science towards enshrining anthropogenic climate change defies plausible explanation  except alternative reality in real world one could argue speaks volumes relative independence scientific process important research climate change could continue published us australia early mid governments countries refused sign kyoto protocol actively undermined global policy making efforts additionally case us federal government shown significant political influence preventing communication current climate science in australia self styled greenhouse mafia consisting key figures fossil fuel industry shown whistleblower guy pearse responsible much federal governments policy climate change time back alternative reality bias surrounding climate research ensuring outcomes supportive anthropogenic climate change produced given global spread climate research institutes must happening every country major scientific research program every university climate research program in alternative reality kind globally orchestrated program influence public funders science every country turn influence universities scientists toe line climate change keep developing apparently fundamentally flawed body science pause moment consider plausibility scenario real world is group people clever enough able sustain level deception three decades this would require orchestration staggering number people funding processes scientists right across world where whistleblowers where exposs where investigative journalists uncovering conspiracy where auditor general departments equivalents monitoring blatant indefensible misallocation public funds the explanation alternative reality must implicit vested interests behind scientific consensus anthropogenic climate change one way explaining away yet another striking anomaly   demonstrated links fossil fuel industry manufacture doubt validity climate science the logic seems demonstrated vested interests one side called debate must vested interests side explain scientific consensus climate change in  bbc journalist richard black invited called sceptics send documentation firm evidence bias undertaking look concrete claims expecting deluge received one first hand claim bias scientific journals backed documentary evidence three second hand claims two well known one scientist question consider evidence anti sceptic feeling so far sum total published explanations alternative reality seems michael crichtons fictional state fear the underlying motivation scale scientific fraud even difficult fathom most people subscribe alternative reality rely creative conspiracy theory ranging neo fascism communism often breath creation new world order plot environmentalists secret agenda bring industrial society yet bizarre alternative reality many australian community implicitly choosing accept escalating numbers dismiss science climate change it real surprise many people would want accept existence anthropogenic climate change the full implications process weve set underway daunting taking meaningful action climate change require economic energy revolution societies appear paralysed status quo for conservative political views increasingly ideologically polarised debate prospect action requires level government intervention fundamentally odds neo liberal views yet time started recognise alternative reality  elaborate illogical implausible work fiction nicole hodgson lectures
