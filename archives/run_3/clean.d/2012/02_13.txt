gillard setting bad example role model married men like porn women dont i thought id like clear confusion explaining bettina trying say dont thank its i youre welcome a young man woman friendly chat yoga class the fresh faced blonde seems relaxed freezes did look chest asks angrily arms folded what described youtube comedy sketch it permitted indeed preferable use internet comedy sketches evidence its generalization its fact like bible yep mutters bloke sheepishly her response fierce cant i go one yoga class without ogled jerk she fierce perhaps period instead cowed takes launching passionate defence action it dangerous man take feisty lady because definitely liberated woman possibly feminist which like terrorists radpads feminists sexually frustrated hate men he brave hero she wrong and angry which unladylike if really didnt want stare beautiful breasts youd wearing something purple sports bra covering maybe one third perfect tits glancing looking staring ogling exactly thing and perfect tits compliment he thinks shes pretty she flattered this exchange typical frequent occurrence perfect tits enjoy provoking men flaunting i know i perfect tits i constantly flaunt to confuse men he argues suggesting among things hes biologically programmed scan life giving breasts future offspring the assertion biological wins arguments immediately because choice intelligent beings rise primitive instincts its called arndts law hes cute passionate ultimately convincing she ends asking coffee hes good punching well weight if liberated women not try home it wont work this comedy sketch not real life he coffee felt sorry and wanted keep looking tits this skit new york media company the kloons attracted million hits youtube the million hits you tube nothing fact word tit title skit features attractive woman lovely breasts breasts would never encourage anyone click link nor would extensive coverage mainstream press legitimizing titillation concern confused men word feminist leading click bait articles mentioning skit generating hits the producers say wasnt meant joke investigate deep chasm men women i know thinking wrong the idea producers retrospectively claiming credit deeper profound social comment originally joke preposterous that chasm indeed deep growing it deep growing you dont need evidence it ask anyone if stand still listen hear so many women feeling entitled dress like  bare breasts enticing flesh squeezed shortest tightest clothing entitled thats right feel entitled how dare who told right wear whatever want without prior approval permission man government what next women feeling entitled equal pay the vote female bosses lady doctors women drivers lesbians everywhere look women stepping dressed provocatively yes everywhere just look particularly tehran kabul and women wearing want selecting wear using criteria provocative to confuse men men play football go jogging get shirtless dressed scantily wearing cool comfortable and right women visually stimulated mens part naked bodies and men definitely visually stimulated mens naked bodies they men and men like looking women bristling wrong man shows enjoys display yes
