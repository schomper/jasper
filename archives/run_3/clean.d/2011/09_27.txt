<Contents>although episode three pretty much worked unlike others partly many vivid characters keating abbott rudd julie bishop tender emotional line thinks theyre getting engaged misheard said fixing government job end i realised trouble the dog bill shorten peed julias leg bent big bum towards audience cleaning urine puddle alone lodge sighing bit i realised genre stab genre hadnt previously existed for wasnt situation comedy like spin city just shoot me frasier since characters genre always fictional and wasnt satirical comedy like yes minister the thick of it in the loop dave characters genre always fictional it wasnt long run political drama like the west wing house of cards goofy jokes people genre fictional it wasnt historical drama like rome deadwood the borgias events didnt parallel really happened could happened the prime minister lodges cook she never drives car she doesnt pet dog she doesnt sex office full people nor resemble original inspiration various wharf revue sketches gillard rudd keating danced sang recapitulations the sound of music the wizard of oz howard janette costello abbott revisited downfall hitler bunker film it none cartoon like bugs bunnyish levity though bigginss much loved keating trickled trickled might say nor like max gilliess famed stage monologues howard hawke robert hughes germaine greer it none suspenseful gob smacked pleasure theatre performance happening flesh eyes recognisable tics victims paraded illuminated celebrated nor like mike carltons radio sketches aural  second comic strips recent events nor like patrick cook column bill leak cartoon paul keating interview crackling one liners it precedent trouble what try impose concept like i love lucy kath and kim sitting prime minister live lover without heed way actually behave amuse the thick of it instance show reproduced political backroom i served  years startling accuracy penetrating foul mouthed hilarity yes minister instance bob hawke told spot each

first bloke in chapter universe reside why call julia gillard tim mathieson why call jane billings tom matthews there arises question privacy tim separated husband children elsewhere living sort gilded adultery nations embattled ruler underemployed constitutionally anomalous does deserve demeaning untruths however cuddlesome first seem told also public figure i doubt a line somehow limits genre crossed crossed philip ruddock might say inappropriately let us imagine series cheryl kernot gareth evans difficulties adultery humanistically portrayed show comically diminished leaders different parties meeting motels discussing national policy undressing a line would crossed wouldnt it might work drama series made  comedy never i portrayed satirically gillies gerry connolly drew forsythe robin ramsey untidy lecherous opinionated gravy spattered highfalutin buffoon always respectable level intellectual attack ive winced never minded returned rule theatre seen if however wife sketch venomously adverted bob ellis fabricated stage figure i think less public figure would rightly upset would i partner  years children this roughly equates present uneasy situation tim mathieson seen national headlice awareness coordinator episode three hoping announce engagement julia im sure deserved although i laughed good bit forlorn comeuppance i guess nation unfairly instances and yes i admired phil lloyds performance he turned meek graeme blundellish fish of water bumbler somehow dignified somehow admirable human i admired performances rudd keating gay disdainful assistant jewellery
