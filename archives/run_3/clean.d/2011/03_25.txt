<Title>Monbiot goes nuclear: too much too soon</Title>
<Contents>prominent british columnist george monbiot announced uk guardian monday supports nuclear power that isnt huge surprise having previously opposed nuclear power announced nuclear neutral  as recently last week monbiot declared neutral saying would oppose nuclear power four conditions met  its total emissions   mine dump   taken account demonstrate genuinely low carbon option  we know exactly waste buried we know much cost pay there legal guarantee civil nuclear materials diverted military purposes along renewables nuclear meets first condition   low carbon energy source the three conditions met no country established burial site high level nuclear waste there clarity much waste disposal programs cost pay we know monitoring management required millenia if roman empire fuelled atomic energy wed still looking waste monbiots fourth condition met   meaningful legal guarantee diversion materials weapons programs unless count nuclear non proliferation treaty actually enshrines inalienable right signatory countries full suite nuclear fuel cycle facilities including useful weapons production so monbiots position hasnt changed result four conditions met indeed mention column monday instead monbiot become nuclear supporter result fukushima nuclear crisis he writes a crappy old plant inadequate safety features hit monster earthquake vast tsunami the electricity supply failed knocking cooling system the reactors began explode melt the disaster exposed familiar legacy poor design corner cutting yet far know one yet received lethal dose radiation  atomic energy subjected one harshest possible tests impact people planet small the crisis fukushima converted cause nuclear power monbiot understating radiological impacts fukushima ignoring serious impacts many many thousands people received small radiation doses result fukushima for tiny unlucky percentage radiation exposure prove fatal thus monbiots claim one yet received lethal dose radiation stand scrutiny we confident death toll fukushima far smaller chernobyl beyond generalisation best speculate data available collective human radiation exposure result crisis monbiot ignores impacts fukushima direct radiation exposure these include restrictions consumption food water milk expense trauma relocating  people serious impacts nuclear crisis emergency response earthquake tsunami big economic hits tourism industry agricultural industries monbiot understates impacts nuclear power generally in terms radiation releases exposures long term exposure uranium tailings dumps estimated much significant source exposure routine reactor operations reactor accidents nuclear fuel reprocessing plants another major source radioactive pollution it small irony nuclear powers worldwide reputation taken huge battering fukushima emergency vastly greater radiological impacts routine operations receive virtually public attention monbiot takes offence ill informed moralistic objections nuclear power fair enough yet two greatest objections nuclear power moral dimension   one particularity generality the particular moral problem concerns disproportionate impacts nuclear industry indigenous peoples the nuclear industrys racism grotesque regardless debates surrounding energy options difficult see pervasive racism reduced another input complex equation tolerated price must paid keep lights the major moral concern nuclear power repeatedly demonstrated connection proliferation nuclear weapons as former us vice president al gore says for eight years white house every weapons proliferation problem dealt connected civilian reactor program and ever got point wanted use nuclear reactors back lot coal  wed put many places wed run proliferation risk right reasonability scale nuclear weapons destructive indiscriminate immoral weapons nuclear warfare capacity directly cause catastrophic climate change lifting thousands tonnes soot stratosphere thus nuclear weapons pose existential threat humanity this proliferation problem must weigh heavily nuclear power comparative assessments energy options much monbiots march  column concerns limitations renewables hes right point limitations costs renewables least poorly understood but instead addressing serious clean energy proposals monbiot simply demolishes one particular branch thinking   argument current electricity supply systems replaced grid small scale distributed energy there certainly role local energy production serious analysts argue completely displace centralised production thus monbiot demolishing straw man argument in australia growing body literature demonstrates systematic deployment renewable energy sources along energy efficiency policies technologies generate large reductions greenhouse emissions without recourse nuclear power these include reports produced academics hugh saddler richard denniss mark diesendorf important contributions australia institute engineer peter seligman csiro scientist john wright siemens ltd beyond zero emissions group among others like fukushima disaster put significant dent nuclear power expansion plans around world fukushima prove even greater disaster energy gap filled fossil fuels it important ever fight systematic rapid deployment existing affordable clean energy solutions and insist major rd programs expand capabilities renewables reduce costs and last least aggressively pursue energy efficiency conservation measures deliver largest cheapest quickest cuts greenhouse emissions jim green national nuclear campaigner friends earth australia </Contents>
