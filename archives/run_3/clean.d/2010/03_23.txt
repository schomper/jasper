<Title>The Drum Wrap: Rudd vs Abbott</Title>
<Contents>what healthcare experts observers think kevin rudd tony abbotts performances debate future australian healthcare read find professor kathy eagar director centre health service development university wollongong as expected todays debate politics health policy certainly reinforced difficult prime minister get bipartisan support plans attempt improve health system but public wants improvements sick political bickering wont get improvements unless people work together theres lot wisdom skill knowledge health system harnassed reform process includes quite lot expertise various health departments well clinicians its easy sides score easy points bagging bureaucrats fact remains health system really needs best managers get after listening debate today competent manager would want continue working health system its time sides stop casting clinicians goodies managers baddies just great clinicians great managers and needed implement reform plans regardless government today debate health care whole focus hospitals both leaders largely silent essential health services   dental care aged care mental health primary care name building whole system around hospitals wrong way round hospitals back rest health system way around i pleased hear prime minister say prepared necessary look different funding approaches small remote hospitals his comments go long way alleviating anxiety small rural communities most prime ministers comments already outlined reform plan there lot detail waiting i suspect may waiting time know full picture the opposition leader present alternative policies substance attempted somewhat unsuccessfully defend track record previous liberal government health spending the fact liberal government increase hospital funding   australian health care agreement but provide adequate indexation states territories  years cover increased costs due  population growth  population ageing  inflation the states territories protested loudly time  avail the outcome five years states territories left pick greater share hospital costs year by  rudd government took office states territories really struggling cover extra costs waiting times public hospitals many cases far long the states territories received significant injection funds rudds first health care agreement better rate indexation built five years existed previous liberal government agreement the question whether prime minister convince states territories hospital reform plan better theyd already offered   agreements already signed cydde miller policy networks manager australian healthcare  hospitals association we recognised late last year discussions announcements health  would framed around pending election this debate played clearly terms some questions cut heart matter health industry stakeholders like australian healthcare hospitals association ahha australian public some answers less enlightening though we found bit rudds national health hospitals network perhaps even local networks would coordinating bodies service integration across hospitals gps allied health aged care specialist services aside statement however little comment rest system outside hospital walls namely primary healthcare aged care we found nothing tony abbotts proposals some argue hes within rights policy announce right debate sprung regardless election year job opposition critical issues like health worked considerably detail coalition showed date what got credible alternative good time   need credible need soon possible one trickier questions came around private health insurance rebate would returned rudd government commit not changing rebate the prime minister said yes still seemed committed putting changes made rebate fairer via means testing lower income earners subsidising people earning mega bucks the ahha supports strongest public hospital system possible several billions dollars spent every year private health insurance rebate doubt responsible part less money go hospitals directly of course coalition commits keeping rebate day introduced tony abbott raised good question impacts governments proposal small rural hospitals needs considerably clarity illumination kevin rudd failed answer the sum total know coalitions health policy australia big metropolitan hospitals nsw queensland get boards governance what small hospitals how governed why would establish many different forms governance system attempting unify bring greater consistency finally one larger concerns ahhas members complete lack action commitment oral healthcare the best question fell leaders australia denticare medicare covering oral healthcare neither the answers characterised politicians react faced problem seems insoluble yes universal dental care expensive targeted dental care less expensive states territories already need immediate support commonwealth expand the ahha developed lower cost solution step brave new world sat well year major parties would seen sides win   implement governments promised commonwealth dental health program healthcare card holders pensioners keep coalitions medicare chronic disease dental program checks items service provided but somehow politics overwhelmed best public neither side willing come clean let us hope characterise future debates decisions leaders parties make professor stephen leeder director menzies centre health policy university sydney first rare encouraging prime minister leader opposition debated health care today this healthy democracy second debate confirmed sides parliament committed securing funding public hospitals directly canberra the need greater local management hospitals also agreed two leaders third neither satisfactory answer need improved dental care currently australians spend dental care cancer yet defies us comes public funding fourth system starved capital the rudd government allocated billions stimulus dollars purpose needed fifth actual increases funding remain unclear management reformed system either party finally rudd formidable debater abbott witty little actually differentiate two policy proposals the record previous government introduced rather late debate more could made it era increasing privatisation this clearly recognised consudering improve public system whatever else money needed dr dennis grube lecturer politics public policy griffith university the prime minister attempted return today script brought lodge his rhetoric echoed heavily ubiquitous term working families childhood family memories opening statement signalled attempt demonstrate connection

appeared top detail attempted strike statesmanlike pose seen reach work opposition attempt juxtaposed uncomfortably criticism tony abbotts record health minister tony abbott struck combative note outset seeking draw debate broader assessment governments record policy delivery contrasting record health minister he continually raised issues insulation scheme building school halls attempted use cut terms capture characterised government failures his previous catch cry great big new tax revised great big new bureaucracy health promised abbott liberal government would deliver real action real difference   perhaps roadtesting potential slogans electoral battle ahead jennifer doggett fellow centre policy development the question sbss karen middleton pocket costs health services revealed black hole centre governments oppositions plans health system reform while leaders acknowledged direct consumer payments health care stay neither could articulate government would address problems current approach issue despite major source health funding contributing twice much private health insurance direct consumer payments largely ignored health reform debate however consumers of pocket costs much important debates level government responsible hospitals quibbles level funding contributed commonwealth co payments crucial determining consumers access health care services access our current system illogical inequitable prevents many consumers accessing care need steers others toward expensive less effective forms care the problem always quantum co payment for many people health care expenses occur unexpectedly coincide reduced earning capacity this makes difficult afford short term although may manageable longer period one solution would approach health care expenses way approach many personal household expenses we generally pay cars houses tertiary education credit card expenses regular planned payments this allows us access goods services need make repayments fit within budget a similar approach health care costs could achieved commonwealth took responsibility paying health care bills deducting relevant subsidies medicare rebates billing consumers directly net of pocket costs allowing make regular repayments could afford pay back full amount straightaway this would ensure everyone could access care needed one would denied necessary health care due high of pocket costs karen middleton right steer debate away hospital funding mechanisms focus of pocket costs health care if prime minister opposition leader want win support community respective health reform policies also focus central issue consumer experience health care professor ian hickie executive director brain mind research centre university sydney what heard today debate half baked plan rudd plan plan abbott plan we informed key issues repeatedly prime minister represented health hospitals his focus clearly waiting times elective surgery hospital beds he spoke consultations community  consultations hospitals to date rudd plan simply modification existing public hospital financing plan again detail system work private sector deliver services real need as commonwealth already funds general practice commitment funding  per cent services simply re statement existing system the additional commitment funding training programs welcome address real issues related current systems

based financing good surgeons procedural medicine doctor dominated local hospital networks hand hand combat state commonwealth bureaucrats in context community priorities left far behind those key community issues mental health alcohol drug services maternal child services dental care under labour plan essential services remain unfunded effectively left limbo after todays debate clearer whether significant improvements key services they highlighted bennett commission key areas dysfunction australian health care system disappointingly straight answers well informed questions the lack attention infrastructure funding gfc reflect poorly national government responsible administering health hopefully media maintain six month campaign get straight answers election mr rudd often described process generation opportunity if outcome current process national government moves share spend traditional  split  government spending remembering governments pay  per cent total costs health care pay  per cent pockets insurance squandered real opportunity in view voters worm give rudd government large opportunity get right eventually punish national state governments fail deliver real new services professor helen christensen centre mental health research the australian national university everybody knows hospital reform important priority as usual focus debate health hospitals

queensland there lot talk health action chance health reform unfortunately escaped us a bigger health system awaits though evidently better one we know apparently pay apparently didnt pay unfortunately debate well actually pay   whether actually get bang buck   still seems long way both debaters equally myopic focusing reactive rather proactive approaches healthcare the health hospital system seems become little health hospitals while preventive health given usual cursory nod misrepresented parties   focusing early treatment rather real prevention where education workplace non health policy non hospital interventions already known effective   cost effective   internationally the pms definition primary care gp gp related care send shivers spines unattended patients overworked gps everywhere lets get debate away superficial doctor nurse waiting list numbers start talking whole of government approaches actually make difference just building new roads little relieve traffic problems become clogged traffic create new hospital beds doctors nurses simply immediately soaked begin addressing upstream factors why actually keeping people hospitals doctor surgeries first place entirely missing debate whilst debate focuses simply rolling failing system chance australia getting health system really face future challenges head diminishes considerably until mopping floor tap still turned james gillespie deputy director menzies centre health policy university sydney the debate offered little new clarify governance questions lie heart current health reform debate abbott offered details coalition policy difficult comment contribution rudd offered little new clarify emphases reforms much momentum rudds reforms gained significant interest groups public opinion responds widespread disquiet excessive centralisation feelings disenfranchisement health care professionals within system the main pillars rudds proposals bear directly questions efficient pricing works institutions given increased autonomy allocate budgets manage services the health hospital networks offer promise increased autonomy responsibility provide direct services much canvas remains blank details slowly emerging   clear planning services across system remain moment state hands difficult see alternative available however clear new commonwealth weight asserted it lot easier judge reforms see primary care population health handled these require much larger units proposed networks like much larger primary care organisations proposed national health hospitals reform commission will health hospital networks nest within larger bodies confining immediate problems clinical governance most important statement future system starts warnings chronic illness ageing society   problems demand better coordination across system prevention primary care hospital aged care so far series policy proposals tiptoe around issues without confronting problem patient care improves across system professor glenn salkeld head associate dean sydney school public health university sydney its hard debate health dont know one side debate coalition stand that said leaders appealed public   families pensioners rural communities we debate public health   everything helps us lead healthy lives whether hospital home community work instead got debate institutional health   health hospitals most people get health care outside hospitals it important hospitals capacity management work efficiently meet population needs acute care more beds wont solve problems rudd recognise importance prevention need education importance primary care aged care care outside hospital but clearly seen leaders main game real reform comes making main game by means lets ensure health institutions assured please lets attention health public real reform comes helping people manage health live work knowing hospitals times everything else fails jane hall professor health economics director centre health economics research evaluation university technology sydney we didnt really learn much two leaders policies expecting a lot predictable however two interesting possibilities opened prime minister one potential funds pooling less reliance case mix activity based funding the first part discussion local networks prime minister suggesting would take preventative medicine aged care community services primary care if funding servies also flowed directly local network raises possibility able move funds one type service another this interesting one criticisms made current plan leaves hospitals isolated rest system this created blame game thats federal versus state different funding streams rigid inflexible there also real hint debate government may resort different funding model total reliance case mix activity based suggestion least cases rural hospitals mechanisms would required sustain service on opposite side interesting tony abbott proud introduction medicare
