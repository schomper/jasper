<Title>Wikileaks shows all leaks are not equal</Title>
<Contents>the publication mass leaked diplomatic cables organisation founded julian assange wikileaks prompted extraordinary response critics supporters alike a number critics labelled wikileaks conduct morally reprehensible organisation acted illegally in almost cases attempt made distinguish actions wikileaks julian assange  approach noted editors publishers whatever kind world overwhether either wikileaks assange broken laws others decide i would simply comment would fundamentally wrong australians however lofty position abandon practical allegiance presumption innocence and would also wrong assange australian citizen abandoned government country  matter outrage conduct wikileaks might occurred home abroad it seems unlikely assange broken australian law  even would quite shameful afforded full weight australian official support due receive citizen the memory david hicks offered americans enough prevent australian government abandoning julian assangeit evident people absolute clarity ethical issues arising wikileaks actions some people certain wikileaks assange ethically justified others equally sure done ethically indefensible what often missing debate analysis given rise conclusionsfirst complex ethical issues need disentangled carefully assessed for example critics wikileaks claiming morally reprehensible person organisation make use information never intended receive or saying specific types information used leaked or saying people entitled use leaked information others wikileaks one could drill much questions  seeking understand difference any using information stolen opposed information lost onsecond important taking position against matter identify explain apparent inconsistency approach for example explain others allowed would allow wikileaks if inconsistencies either noticed explained charges hypocrisy insincerity may weaken positionlet us consider first range issues as rule people would agree wrong use property people without permission this even property dishonestly removed owner for example imagine seeing  note slip pocket old man walking ahead although really need money could pick money keep without anyone noticing it might count unexpected windfall however money clearly property  lost man fault what could return man little effort part in circumstances default position return money rightful ownerit often surprising note number people agree lost money returned yet would readily exploit windfall form lost information for example quite common people argue commercial political circles entitled exploit advantage information lost opponents this despite fact information clearly many cases lost fault information when pressed people often struggle explain would return money keep information where explanation offered usually involves one following elements people losing information careful would thing rules particular game allow they right keep information confidential may use information greater goodit last reason used invoke greatest sense legitimacy too often journalists publishers politicians partys interest really advanced  cloaked vestments public interest needs distinguished public interested inthe people wikileaks must exercise kind outlined justify use information clearly belongs someone else never intended see use indeed arguments used wikileaks justify actions probably little different relied upon politicians journalists exploit leaked material  often ways seem advancement sectional interests rather public given would seem incumbent criticise wikileaks renounce use leaks general provide clear reasons wikileaks may use leaked information others including allowed exploitsome critics wikileaks responded challenge arguing indiscriminate release classified secret material distinguishes wikileaks conduct others legitimately exploit leaked material specifically claim made wikileaks endangered lives people this potentially powerful criticism wikileaks most journalists politicians quite content use information capable destroying careers marriages etc however seems clear line drawn comes releasing information could put lives risk  principle applied number areas eg publishing methods employed suicide etcif nub criticism wikileaks  morally reprehensible exploit ill gotten information ways put lives others risk  powerful case wikileaks supporters media elsewhere must answerhowever also case must answered wikileaks trenchant criticslet us suppose bundle  classified documents diplomatic cables etc belonging government peoples republic china fall hands government united states america do imagine americans would say how unfortunate we must immediately return material chinese  quickly return lot without reading word of course the us intelligence services would material and trawl cache revealed information person considered threat national security would exploit information  even point removing threat lethal means in words united states like government would hesitation exploiting secret information worth  even endanger lives and us government would acting predominantly exclusively national interesti focused us case shoe foot americans classified information lost leaked stolen probably word best applied cases covered euphemism leaked if critics wikileaks credible need explain justifiable nations use others information often gathered illegally target country illicit covert intelligence operations  narrow national interests  unjustifiable wikileaks use kind information relatively disinterested fashion making available allthis suggest wikileaks adopt standard higher applied governments in opinion wikileaks diligent ensuring greatest extent possible nothing expose others heighten risk death physical injury the wrongs others make right wikileaks act indiscriminately in saying wikileaks publish material claim bring bear close editorial process designed avoid harmswikileaks julian assange published material governments intended remain secret the issues debated complex important unfortunately debate leaving much unsaid unchallenged sides i would hope candour consistency argument  especially criticalthat said one cannot remark night julian assange roundly criticised quarters australian journalists conferred greatest honour another one laurie oakes he received gold walkley award use leaked confidential information manner helped shape outcome national electionone complicating factors case widespread unrestricted publication information internet in past publishers leaked information justified actions claiming public right know referring particular public  ordinarily citizens particular nation that argument australians right know australian information americans right know american information etc but chinese russians name two interested groups right know american information vice versa what wikileaks case invites us consider whether right know extended peoples relation information  irrespective source national identitythis debate worth  debate made necessary distributive power internet emergence organisations wikileaks publishers journalists julian assange dr simon longstaff executive director st james
