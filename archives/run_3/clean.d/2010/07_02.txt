<Title>Dreaming of greener pastures</Title>
<Contents>lin hatfield dodds sound like green elections past this raising public consciousness certain issues building party brand tells group new greens volunteers what trying win act senate seat thats goal thats im running thats i want the greens always one major problem comes elections  theyre obsessed winning its dont like win they like much but party hasnt always brought laser like intensity contest opponents some members still harbour suspicion power corrupts believe party watchdog bastion integrity rather mainstream political force interested brokering deals so arent completely gutted candidates arent successful they console important thing theyve taken principled stand given voice object policies major parties but ms hatfield dodds theres way i would stepped job i role i adored social justice advocacy i personally didnt think really good chance winning says its tough ask i think possible ducks lined way havent theres certainly bit momentum behind ms hatfield dodds high profile candidate whos got deep roots canberra whos built national presence social justice campaigner the greens vote building steadily act senate seat tantalisingly close grasp the party won  per cent upper house vote  throwing considerable resources contest time around were underdogs theres doubt certainly achievable national campaign manager ebony bennett said in  greens candidate kerrie tucker missed around two thousand votes lot closer people might believe but theres catch the greens arent going get primary votes labor liberals that means theyre going strip  plus votes weaker opponent   liberals   rely preferences get line if dont force liberal vote well quota senate seat  per cent game ms hatfield dodds could easily milk dissatisfaction amongst left wing labor voters unhappy partys policies asylum seekers climate change prise thousand votes labor senator kate lundy get absolutely nowhere thats party painting great big target liberal senator gary humphries head trying woo coalition voters tying closely leader tony abbott the greens convinced whatever appeal places like penrith mackay abbott popular canberra and opposition leader hasnt done humphries favours proposing two year freeze public service recruitment the greens already rushed radio advertisements leaflets lambasting proposal conjuring dire spectre house prices spiralling like rather savage cuts  when mutterings freeze humphries came publicly said ill talking partys leadership influencing ms hatfield dodds said the upshot two year recruitment freeze tony abbott becomes prime minister theres question mark mind effectiveness party ms bennett says end day gary humphries end day votes tony abbotts liberal party thats party doesnt support tackling climate change thats party supports return pacific solution  i dont think thats direction people like see australia going said still stubborn facts greens cant wish away must tempering optimism first gary humphries moderate popular local representative hes always sensitive antenna local issues strong contrarian streak hairy chested turn phrase comes public service act self determination he might muted since rather surprising promotion tony abbott still point long record polite dissent inside outside coalition party room voters persuasions remember decision cross floor vote colleagues vetoed sex civil union laws act  hes also thoughtful readily accessible all earned widespread respect allowed carve secure niche canberras local political landscape hell hard dislodge second liberals senate primary vote isnt large canberra resilient its never dropped  per cent it strayed dangerously low  hit  per cent but democrats put prominent candidate year one nation ran well sapping liberals primary vote at stage arent centre right parties lining tilt seat the greens must hoping like mad motorists party something ilk decide take shot badly need another player race capable eroding liberals support all tough ask its worth remembering  labor democrats greens ran rare concerted campaign advocacy group getup effort dislodge humphries destroy coalitions senate majority the greens also high profile candidate time around could also capitalise strong undercurrent hostility towards john howard they came agonisingly close still couldnt unseat humphries so whats changed is tony abbott really distasteful prospect local liberal wets john howard  weighed baggage  year reign covered scar tissue culture wars abc election analyst antony green says stage cant see liberals would fall beneath quota time around lose seat the greens energised theyve certainly got shot contest theyre still searching game changer and moment hard pick one its equally hard discern impact julia gillards ascension top job means race at first glance spells trouble greens after national lower house vote plunged  per cent newspoll took top job left wing voters flocked back alp but even drains greens support its clear impact shell liberal primary vote one really matters some even argue rise power actually give greens boost convincing left wing voters gillard win inevitable this would allow cast vote greens without risking abbott caliphate progressive warriors mutter darkly it fascinating race it close the greens probably wont make small bit history canberra but give red hot go and great watch </Contents>
