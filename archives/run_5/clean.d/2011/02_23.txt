<Title>Earthquake Q&A</Title>
<Contents>geoscience australia earthquake seismologist dr trevor allen answers abc news onlines questions earthquakes work causing much chaos new zealand city christchurch on february   shallow  magnitude quake ripped christchurch killing least  people leaving many  others missing the city getting back feet experiencing even stronger  magnitude quake september   q what earthquake occur a what happening earths crust tectonic plates moving continuously what actually puts stress rocks boundaries tectonic plates internally within plates so stress becomes great rocks rocks actually break essentially thats causes earthquake they tend break along weakest part rocks generally pre existing fault line q are different types earthquakes a the one happened yesterday beneath christchurch february   call shallow crustal earthquake those earthquakes generally occur beneath land generally quite shallow less  kilometres deep theyre ones produce biggest impact society ones worried haiti also one other earthquakes subduction zone earthquakes this one tectonic plate subducts beneath another tectonic plate that actually case start north island new zealand also south island two subduction zones they generate largest earthquakes see also similar  boxing day tsunami magnitude  earthquake sumatra recently new zealand experienced much larger earthquakes theyve subduction zones generally offshore so theyre offshore theyre reasonable distance population tend much damage built environment within earthquakes plate boundary earthquakes also intraplate earthquakes ones occur australia theyre earthquakes generally less frequent places like australia still generate large earthquakes internal forces work inside tectonic plates these quakes much less frequent ones plate boundaries new zealand q what different causes a the ones new zealand due plate boundary forces you also get earthquakes generated volcanic activity q what difference earthquake aftershock a there difference probably difference aftershocks generally tend occur faulted surface ruptured recently all aftershocks occurring moment christchurch essentially occurring fault surface ruptured yesterday generally rupturing new rock new pieces rock theyre adjustment earthquakes earth essentially resettling preferred state as resettles causing smaller earthquakes we dont think yesterdays earthquake new zealand aftershock septembers looks ruptured different section either fault ruptured september fault plane adjacent near one ruptured september the two earthquakes definitely related new rupture different part fault q how long aftershocks last a every earthquake different some earthquakes may get aftershocks september earthquake noticed long aftershock sequence probably still continue another  months we would expect see similar sort pattern emerging earthquake saw yesterday but diminish magnitude frequency occurrence time q what common misconceptions people earthquakes a one occur plate boundaries we know australia certainly located plate boundary yet observed earthquakes large larger one occurred christchurch yesterday in  three large earthquakes one day near tennant creek northern territory they ranged magnitude    thankfully large population exposure large communities nearby essentially damage earthquake demonstrates large earthquakes australia another misnomer perpetuated moment lot people think large earthquakes occurring lately particularly  seeing frequent large earthquakes but truth part earths natural processes it happens seem falling places lots people we might see spikes earthquake activity particular periods might also see times quiescence dont see much activity q do earthquakes happen around world daily basis a yes on average youre looking least five six earthquakes greater magnitude  day generally see two three earthquakes magnitude  greater per week a lot offshore subduction zones theyre reasonable distance away populated areas dont get news coverage ones christchurch get q what made february  christchurch quake destructive a we know magnitude september quake much larger we asked lot earthquake didnt generate much damage the thing quake much larger area ground shaking also much larger however occurred relatively remote area lot people living area occurred dense exposure i would say whereas yesterdays earthquake magnitude smaller area maximum ground shaking also smaller area maximum ground shaking almost direct hit city christchurch thats seeing much damage it really function earthquakes location a lot buildings christchurch also pre existing damage septembers earthquake i guess large job go around fix damages lot buildings vulnerable ground shaking form yesterdays earthquake q how compare previous quakes region a i suppose still unravelling terms bad quake actually the deadly earthquake historically new zealand actually occurred  killed  people city napier economically speaking probably worst earthquake struck region terms fatalities yet seen q is way knowing whether pattern christchurch continue a new zealand overall experience frequent large earthquakes i guess seismologist job try understand likelihood particular faults rupture unfortunately tectonics new zealand complex cant identify every single fault for example one occurred september didnt know fault existed prior earthquake makes job difficult in christchurch area expect see aftershocks earthquake there maybe small likelihood another large earthquake could generated its unusual following lager earthquake might trigger another quake adjacent joining fault line by moving one piece rock youre putting pressure bits rock away q how long take rebuild earthquake scale a i think kiwis general fairly resilient i think theyll bounce back in terms long take rebuild city  going least  months city functioning there going ongoing issues soil liquefaction design strong buildings withstand earthquakes strong foundation built q what chances similar series quakes striking australia a the chances something scale occurring australia much much lower new zealand because sitting middle tectonic plate dont plate boundary forces putting stress rocks within continent so generally dont experience frequent earthquake activity large country essentially could earthquake magnitude anywhere country </Contents>
