<Title>Squishy aspirations not enough</Title>
<Contents>when kevin rudd attends un climate change talks bali week first australian prime minister history attend international environmental conference its strong signal it indicates importance climate change rudds political fortunes australia   developed country ecologically vulnerable effects global warming   world his attendance follows first executive act prime minister   ratifying kyoto protocol un ese lodging instrument ratification this action earned australian delegation minute heartfelt applause announced floor un conference i wonder whether howard annoyed  half years obdurate refusal ratify kyoto propelled rudd international superstardom within hours becoming prime minister however questions remain whether warm signals sent australias ratification kyoto protocol reflected cold hard stance negotiators conference rudd said intends bridge gap developed developing country positions show global leadership move negotiations forward the signs far mixed australian leadership climate change negotiations three key elements first rudd need work maintain broaden deepen support substantial binding emissions reductions developed countries working cooperatively developing countries china india help make substantial contributions global effort tackle climate change second need accept adopt stringent emissions reductions third need massively increase support poor countries communities struggling adapt respond impacts climate change already experiencing on first point prime minister told media us get board ratify kyoto protocol hes keen press point one one meets us president washington next year thats gold star pr bronze star substance its right call make makes rudd look good almost certainly ignored us and comes engaging kyoto waverers japan canada australia seems little in fact australian delegation twice outlined preference kyoto style binding emissions reductions targets developed countries long term aspirational global emissions reduction goal this formulation   familiar recent climate change statements apec commonwealth loved former government   lets rich countries hook terms moral obligation practical ability set meet binding targets and course notion squishy aspirational goal drive hard reductions required chance avoiding extremely dangerous climate change seems   like second marriage   triumph hope experience aspirations well good without hard binding mechanisms achieve aspirations world playing fire engaging china high priority rudd least able show fluency mandarin though without alexander downer present take umbrage but needs recognised china accepting limit urgent poverty reduction work accepting reductions targets already lot reduce emissions chinas fuel efficiency standards stringent australia canada united states  chinas vehicle fleet almost twice efficient australias l   km china set renewable energy target  percent primary energy   percent increase  levels it setting stringent efficiency standards energy production industry closing decomissioning inefficient factories power plants supporting efforts major developing economies critical rudd well placed fresh face scene help process on second point setting meeting targets australian delegation caused minor stir bali affirming recent un proposal developed countries must adopt reductions targets   percent   levels this widely reported australian media led clarification rudd government accept range basis ongoing negotiations would wait ross garnaut delivers report i sympathy   given little action information bequeathed former government   big bridge building plank australia could lay bali emissions reduction targets line responsibility capacity finally australia need much help poor countries adapt current future impacts climate change ive heard bangladeshi delegates talking impact rising temperatures agriculture food security water availability the delegations small island states already point sea level rise salt water intrusion increasing intensity storm surges affecting vulnerable communities extreme weather events like recent cyclone sidr bangladesh likely increase frequency intensity world warms overwhelmingly cause greatest devastation poor countries helping adapt climate change optional extra discussions fundamental fair global deal climate change must emerge first kyoto protocol commitment period   current commitments support adaptation fall far short scale need hysterical tragic depending whether natural response laugh cry the best estimate scale global adaptation needs poor countries around us billion per year this estimate comes oxfam earlier world bank estimates us us billion the two funds currently exist support adaptation entirely dependent donor commitments predictably fall well short scale need donors promises of nearly  million pledged far  million paid australia made first contribution   paltry  million   least developed countries fund year so newleadership yet i guess unfair judge
