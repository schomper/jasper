<Title>Misrepresenting the evidence in the great porn debate</Title>
<Contents>not long ago gail dines came australia her tour speaking engagements including qa attracted lot attention campaign message basically porn bad bad men bad women bad women perform she believes performances women consist primarily exclusively women forced violent degrading sexual practices when howard jacobson suggested something natures makes us want watch porn dines retorted i refuse accept boy came homing device gagonmycockcom debates porn among women identify feminists go back  years in pro porn feminists identified sex positive feminists the prominent anti porn feminists catharine mackinnon andrea dworkin in view better arguments evidence side sex positive feminists comprehensive rebuttal macdworkin position provided former american civil liberties union president nadine strossen defending pornography for part dines adopted type censorship model dworkin mackinnon freely acknowledged dworkins influence the place i discovered power radical feminism when i read andrea dworkins work life turned upside all sudden i could make sense life understand i treated way i i broke free ideological myths patriarchy delivers women first time i felt like i could really see world since s porns reach expanded now west least people internet access people ready access porn if people voting err mouse clicking fingers people voting porn as i googled word porn i found  results a years ago canadian study hoping compare men watch porn havent encountered derailed   researchers couldnt find men hadnt indulged x rated material it seems enormous market based really basic pervasive urges among men women would take considerable state intervention try close industry modest task dines sets as argument old question dines persuasive new arguments evidence finally turn society porn well signs seem good leslie cannold posted excerpts academic review two books pornography journal called violence against women one reviewed books dines pornland it concluded the books review offer little useful evidence based information overall books present extremely biased picture pornography stands stark contrast sound scholarly research more recently convenient way test claims dines new left project ran four part debate pornography dines british journalist sarah ditum tracing threads debate view deeply revealing i think debate shows lack good faith part dines disturbing approach evidence in view revealing thread debate in part one ditum writes dines claims text slew psychological studies support claim porn indeed help shape worldviews men masturbate yet endnotes cites one review  this poor scholarship dines replies point directly i quote length i surprised find clear error ditums account pornland she states i discuss studies i cite one study  she goes say poor scholarship damn right who make generalisation citing one study not i cite  study footnote  chapter  then footnote  i cite pamela pauls qualitative study  footnote  i cite article neil malamuth tamara addison mary koss annual review sex research i talk article book review meta analytical studies effects porn this means malamuth colleagues detailed analysis  years worth studies they cherry pick studies instead examine weight evidence conclude experimental research shows exposure non violent violent pornography results increases attitudes supporting sexual aggression actual aggression does ditum think malamuth one respected researchers world field going make wild claim without first looking body research accumulated  years ditum wants sturdy evidence accept porn effect consumers if hundreds peer reviewed articles dont constitute sturdy evidence i dont know if dines one footnote claim ditum made error dines footnotes obviously different points dines implies ditum claimed one study cited pornland obviously point ditum made ditum saying dines made claim supported one study  dines cannot refute saying parts book cites studies this seems rather elementary point ditum responds directly malamuths study said while malamuth et al tentatively endorse idea association pornography consumption sexual violence stop long way short asserting causal relationship i quote paper length on basis research available feasible gauge relative importance media influence generally pornography particular relation factors  it unlikely type pornography exerts powerful influence large numbers people interested readers consult study a lot study technical difficult page  reports we cannot conclude basis analyses pornography cause outcome sexually aggressive tendencies both although association appear spurious relationship on page  explain scientific causal models may  better framed terms confluence several factors for test familiar people study practice law that but porn x wouldnt happen it concludes seems correlation particularly sexually aggressive men frequent pornography use suggesting need increased research attention use impact pornography men elevated risk sexual aggression however current findings suggest majority american men pornography exposure even highest levels assessed associated high levels sexual aggression in short study hedges findings many ways hardly seems accurately represented dines claim researchers wrote study showered praise conclude ditum stresses alarming dines use study support argument porn makes users sexual aggressors discredit disadvantage would benefit open debate nature influence pornography furthermore alarming dines misrepresenting research order propagate ideological line counter human rights that strong way put i see else interpret work academic shows severe disregard caveats put place reports authors dines opportunity reply length particular claim   indeed allocated  words about five months later dines sent brief reply according ditum dines address issue dines declared would end debate at root deep philosophical differences after dines radical feminist opposed commodification human life presumably ditum supposed favour dines goes make kind claims sex industry workers ive repeatedly heard vehemently rejected sex workers organise scarlet alliance sex industry network adelaide rife bad faith dines deign address anything ditum wrote grandly claims i studies sleeve prove guyland men women deserve true equality as civil rights political principle empirical question in event studies change world we believe future free oppression cornerstone future world free commodified sex media landscape reproduce patriarchal culture this truth hold dear study argument theory persuade us otherwise to claim debate another woman studies prove women deserve true equality  i cannot think word properly encapsulate audacious effrontery as final example dines bad faith substitution rhetorical games evidence consider vignette first contribution i remember giving lecture hideous conference yale university law school i anti porn feminist panel six nauseated pro porn drivel coming panellists i went sit library lunchtime away colleagues i got talking cleaner woman pulling double shift weekend pay daughters college tuition nearby public university i wondered woman would made listening bunch academics talk porn empowering women scrubbing floors daughters education i bet would thought academics lost minds to show radical describes talking cleaner i guess really cares side workers like snooty highbrow capitalists speak yale why didnt dines ask cleaner thought porn perhaps dines busy side what possible relevance anecdote what could possibly prove it said people right opinions facts to argue manner i think fundamentally shows level disrespect audience in view writers primary duty truth they present evidence views carefully readers make minds persuaded evidence presented author everyone makes mistakes occasion inadvertently misrepresent evidence dines appears regard evidence distraction truth holds dear irrespective study argument theory in view dines shown cannot trusted readers
