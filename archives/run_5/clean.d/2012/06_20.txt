i sure answer yes and covered six seven elections held independent papua new guinea since  question i believe papua new guineans debating although i png year independence working stage nbc i came back australia first post independence poll  but i back two elections two abcs png correspondent i travelled base brisbane report   elections and im hoping abcs international tv service australia network let go report seventh png national poll next month let put concerns suitability current system perspective relating stories astounding i found spectacle election campaigns voting png ill start    kundiawa airstrip shut transport minister deputy prime minister iambakey okuk could extended take bigger aircraft the airport middle okuks electorate it made great venue election rally okuks version massive wealth distribution vote buying exercise julia gillard wayne swan tried similar stunt australian budget even brazen efforts could hardly match iambakeys panache that day   week voting began

abc radio program the world today a week ago counting full swing one seats central province group men mountains back abau electorate walked provincial town count conducted they told officials counting station people hills still waiting mobile polling team stop could cast votes oh box village counted told incredulous asked who vote when given name candidate every single vote box marked favour said according source hes dead man he didnt win seat may still alive in  tales like electoral system hijacked candidates supporters abounded while voting still going central province i sent e mail old friend worked png solomon islands catholic bishops conference detailed number incidents aware happening sapphire creek way east port moresby he said hed found names two children sapphire creek roll and hed told time time different people cleaned ink fingers voted twice thrice even often they concept wrong said pointing saw legitimate way countering behaviour others he also wrote one young woman found name already marked voted advised helpful electoral officer pointed name another woman yet voted told could use name now election  that year i convinced foreign correspondent program let go camera team cover election campaign laigap porgera electorate i chose laigap porgera number reasons one lead  election possibly even tumultuous year we sandline crisis military revolting use british south african led mercenaries bougainville mercenaries bundled deported accusations military commander chans government corrupt riots streets around taurama intersection siege parliament prime minister briefly stepping aside commission inquiry what i wanted show major national events would next impact elected laigap porgera   i would argue electorates png i wanted explain voting papua new guinea voting governments its voting members laigap porgera took porgera gold mine brought considerable development electorate perverse result service delivery seen mines responsibility governments one thing i wanted highlight   partially corrected since    way old first past the post winner takes system counting resulting increasingly unrepresentative democracy seats like laigap porgera nine ten people voted losers finally i wanted illustrate many parts png local member regarded somewhat like local atm machine   everyone even didnt vote special invisible atm card expected mp honour a quotes people spoke campaign reveal well the sitting member anton pakena told chance candidate vehicles at moment said im running  vehicles road new ones and youve got feed people   tinned fish packed rice coffee sugar and youve got give money many things youve got give money wont support i asked right replied emphatically if dont give money wont support he said election campaign costing  one anton pakenas supporters sol taro allowed us film one two shops sol taro one porgera gold mine landowners got royalties gold mine in previous election delivered village votes pakena showered money public purse k worth vehicles money church k start another business with refreshing frankness typical people png sol quite happy tell k grant never went intended purpose his proposal new business rejected said i used money buying drink buying beer buying food i big family  i couldnt hold onto when i asked supported anton gave revealing answer because hes member members hold key money i supported bought truck its big dyna the money anton able dispense came called electoral development funds these funds png finance department disparagingly called members slush funds various names years i asked anton take project spent funds much surprise took inspect complete failure it egg production business inside huge shed rows rows empty chicken cages covered cobwebs discarded bags chicken feed scattered across floor empty cardboard egg cartons everywhere a tarpaulin draped one end building flapped breeze hed donated k egg project poor quality control high prices meant collapsed i asked money wasted wasted agreed nodding then added not project but projects area is frustrating i wanted know it embarrassing replied but may people hed helped according anton pakena however debt owed vote it didnt save pakena lost he managed attract   might sound low good enough second place there  candidates laigap porgera eventual winner year    popular vote   opis papo put university porgera mine campaigned strongly theme mine enough people i interviewed one supporters young mother jospehine pawe village in election told filmed giving young baby bath i think opis papo win and wins im going good life josephine high school i asked people heard sandline troubles port moresby they dont know anything replied i heard predictions years election png could troubled violent  elections even ive skimmed back

election related violence  the  election whole lot better huge emphasis security there problems this one report i year in highlands clansmen returning officer accused diverting helicopters undesignated polling places killed three people heading village confront apart better security introduction limited preferential voting also credited reduced volatility  one improvement   much orderly post election phase lead first meeting parliament previously extraordinary tug war allegiance individual mps i drawer full stories newly elected mps describing whisked lock that held virtual solitary confinement even tales climbing hotel windows escape join another side now governor general must invite leader party wins seats try form government seems worked far the change sir mekere morauta introduced led nine years sir michael somares rule integrity political parties law aimed stabilising political parties halting sudden defections some aspects law ruled unconstitutional make life quite difficult whoever emerge prime minister months time what main issue i suggesting problems afflicting current political setup png arise electoral system australia introduced    single member electorates like weve got house representatives its knew gave png with modifications adjustments png  open single member electorates election  single member province wide electorates its  till election another two provinces highlands the theory classic westminster system members representatives people   thats sort right place like great britain australia but png morphed situation member much representative leader people expected deliver everything totally beholden demands electorate as sol taro told back laigap porgera  the members hold key money is right is way papua new guinea progress are members parliament simply bled dry   keep supply blood got hooked transfusion tubes running way back treasury port moresby i certainly dont perfect answer but let suggest alternative might offer less difficult political future melanesia i say melanesia perplexing problem papua new guinea my job covering rest pacific situation members expected make local atm shared poor politicians solomon islands its quite bad vanuatu number multiple member electorates but example i would like share tonight last island group bottom melanesian island chain new caledonia new caledonia divided three provinces   south heavily populated includes noumea north second populous loyalty islands the congress new caledonia   parliament    seats there also three provincial legislatures voted time combined total  members   go sit new caledonian congress to simplify matters ill limit  congress as i said southern province largest provides  mps northern province provides  loyalty islands  voting province wide south instance  mps elected congress elector gets one vote parties nominate lists candidates if stand independent name appears as long party gets  vote guaranteed one seat rest divided proportionally depending partys share total now interesting thing   impressed dame carol kidu pngs current opposition leader i explained   party presenting list alternate male female candidates so man number one list woman number two man third woman fourth etc etc or woman number one man number two it means new caledonias congress almost half female i often wondered papua new guinea would run  women mps one man instead  men one woman under system would roughly half half could interesting png the requirement new caledonia formation call collegiate government that party secures certain proportion seats invited join government so noumea government made anti independence parties pro independence coalition flnks in interview i recently nic maclellan freelance journalist specialised french pacific said three elections since  collegiate model adopted relations independence coalition three major conservative pro france parties improved significantly i covered violence conflict new caledonia trip back two months ago australian governor general i could see improvement how would work png well could province wide multiple member electorates instead electing governor people vote entire block members province or could even region wide   highlands islands momase papua that would extremely radical away governors altogether but would almost certainly encourage development stronger parties its perfect the government new caledonia fallen apart twice matters like flag new caledonia look like but im throwing idea on collegiate government issue stephen pokawin put practice manus provincial governments still operating premier i recall story i visited manus set series committees manus provincial assembly every member involved the chairmen committees made cabinet i may biased i think provincial government working manus although i concede disastrous places i suppose i saying seems demands pressures placed members parliament png constituents close impossible satisfy sometimes desperate attempts meet totally unrealistic expectations makes good governance   i say   bit challenge one final point going back though notes i found one political parties put candidates  engaging name simple peoples party it badly   getting single simple peoples party candidate elected i surprised if one thing i learnt png past  years last thing could accuse papua new guineans simple perhaps intelligent extremely complicated peoples party would stand better chance time round </Contents>
