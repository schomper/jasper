<Title>Commander tells of attack on Aust troops</Title>
<Contents>following full transcript interview commanding officer australian troops mosul lieutenant colonel ian cruickshank matt pulford abcs international unit matt pulford lieutenant colonel give us brief description events took place lieutenant colonel ian cruickshank okay matt this morning sitting breakfast awaiting iraqi personnel come back leave start mornings training short  oclock heard couple rounds impacting local area we ascertained probably mortar rounds obviously fired threat forces on third impact realised location currently reside mortared all australians iraqis coalition forces undercover stage moved rooms australian point view conducted wed rehearsed case eventuality after  minutes mortaring ceased stage   i moved men pre prepared positions accounted australians the americans accounted personnel iraqi personnel accounted stage determined   early stage   five casualties mp how intense bombardment ic it fairly slow bombardment period indirect fire i think theyd done theyd fired first couple rounds range position got range started walking   describe   walking rounds towards us all rounds impacted outside hardened location   building one round actually physically landed within compound occupy mp so close metres ic all rounds impacted  metres away main building one rounds impacted quadrangle building occupy its two storey old fort   quite solid old fort   impacted edge wall   corner floor wall no one close people reasonably close next level mp how close mortar rounds come hitting australian people serving iraq ic the rounds   closest rounds i guess something vicinity   metres away but i say angle round actually hit   men next floor shrapnel effect indirect fire impacted lower wall ground floor so guys verandah   solid cement verandah mp coming fire something youd probably expect   would fair say people   first time theyve come fire ic theres doubt matt theres doubt mind first time fellas would come indirect fire observation acquitted well every member team acquitted well mp how feeling throughout troops ic i think circumstances people arent  theyre concentrating conducting drills practise instinctive drills practise the first thing happened course every one team leaders accounted men different rally points hardened area  directly afterwards direction teams moved preprepared positions preparation sort eventualities so i think pretty instinctive i guess thing peoples minds stage looking mates wed trained earlier occupation particular location mp there number iraqis injured i believe could give details ic in total six iraqi officers senior ncos injured in fact bar one returned duty stage minor fragmentation wounds legs   secondary fragmentation broken glass cement chips only one remains hospital taken one coalition hospitals admitted well get update time tonight mp so australian officers render medical assistance ic i corporal medic part team corporal medic rendered immediate assistance supported iraqi personnel coalition staff theres young american corporal assisted well mp so australians involved treatment ic absolutely absolutely the leading member assisted treatment like sort prioritised people worst least injured australian   australian corporal assisted american corporal iraqi officers senior ncos also assisted mp the extent wounds  youre saying mostly light shrapnel wounds extremities ic thats correct five six shrapnel wounds lower legs one case foot one gentlemen light wound back another one piece glass nicked eye   evacuated werent sure whether eye damage course hes come back hes okay the person injured probably worst young sergeant received shrapnel wounds shoulder he evacuated werent sure whether may bee serious damage done i mentioned hes taken one coalition hospitals hes currently observation i dont medical confirmation status stage mp i guess bit shock ic it wasnt way id expected day start matt we camera crew going filming training planned day interesting start day something hadnt planned obviously it good test procedures the iraqis worked well consultation concert coalition members i pretty satisfied coalition members procedures conducted once got wounded evacuated essentially started training day iraqi battalions training us continued training dinner  oclock evening mp could explain us unit near mosul ic im leading training team australian army its designated  iraqi army training team essentially assisting advising number battalions iraqi army assisting training leading period time theyll conduct recruit training theyve recruited soldiers well advise phase training well go advanced training iraqi army mp you didnt manage locate people firing mortars ic no didnt the mortars fired position we approximated position fired fired refer dead ground ground cant see   like creek bed example couldnt see the problem course theres lot movement around place   lot people in location moment theres lot wheat harvesting ongoing local villagers moving sheep around large flocks quite hard pinpoint stage there coalition reaction force reacted location try identify mortar base plate position done fairly short time   good reaction coalition partners   failed find firers weapon mp just last week mosul major attack have higher status alert upcoming handover recent incidents ic no havent my force protection measures weve got particular location havent changed essentially take force protection advice superior headquarters case ive modified slightly ensure weve got best possible support theres requirement even moment change i regard fairly stringent force protection measures mp so real danger australian troops stationed ic i guess matt moment area still considered combat zone coalition i dont think threat us greater anywhere else stage iraq
