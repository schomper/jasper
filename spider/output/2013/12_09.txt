<DOC_NAME>Australia should fund foreign aid. Here's why.</DOC_NAME>
<TEXT>
Foreign aid logical outcome prosperous democratic culture The Coalitions decision cut foreign aid one quietly brings question humanism underpins culture writes Joe McKenzie In 2010 David Cameron conservative British prime minister embarked policy savage austerity fundamentally altered size scope UKs government continues defining reason Britain remains recession today The cuts Cameron made utterly dwarf anything Joe Hockey could imagine let alone politically enact yet refused cut budget two departments National Health Service foreign aid Let clear little I agree David Cameron refusing cut foreign aid indeed condition coalition agreement Liberal Democrats Cameron consistently defended decision saying foreign aid budget makes proud British He suffered political price too The far right UKIP party exploited many times claiming Cameron spending money Bongo bongo land rather UK Meanwhile Australia LNP announced cut 45 billion foreign aid budget instead invest roads Considering current AusAid budget 52 billion devastating result Australias commitment foreign aid The saddest thing LNP lose single vote this The people concerned cuts never going vote Tony Abbott first place swinging voters marginal seats probably saw act fiscal responsibility You dont win votes funding foreign aid certainly electoral price associated cutting areas health education But crueller dumber insular nation cuts Which brings around answer question I started with fund foreign aid If electorally unimportant even exist first place By far one odious arguments end foreign aid Australias strategic interests which true repellent justification current aid budget   grotesquely pragmatic argument equivalent opposing death penalty based purely fact victims might found innocent It actually Australias strategic interest give aid one thing gives us gigantic amount leverage neighbours makes policies like PNG solution possible Its also true broader sense example funding secular schools Indonesia prevents spread fundamentalist Islam But saying aid strategic decision precisely kind thinking allows cut say Coalition wont create new way gaining leverage Pacific neighbours The aid strategy line also justified pork barrelling repressive dictators Cold War practice threatens legitimacy international development projects Aid programs developed huge degree strategic thinking current allocation aid reflects that isnt it On end spectrum idea foreign aid nice Much like taking neighbours rubbish bins sunny suburban morning nation nice thing try support countries around us combating poverty This line reasoning equates Australia giving foreign aid private citizens donating charity foreign aid giant Project Compassion box nations spare change The problem that again line reasoning used justify cuts Make mistake Coalition implements cuts senior Liberals come news say cuts regrettable They wail gnash teeth hard come decision cut nice things Tony Abbott personally houses orphans home barely push up without entering charity fun runbike ride But budget emergency sometimes cant afford nice things The truth foreign aid untouchable like clearly Britain austerity Foreign aid strategic nice justifying preposterous wealth both economic otherwise society live in Australians enjoy incredibly high standard living relative abundance wealth particularly compared geographic neighbours The idea cannot afford spend fraction wealth improving lives poor utter nonsense More importantly live democratic society centred around protecting rights citizens institutions And free democratic society obligation concerned dignity human beings obligation extends beyond strategy niceness instead application values actually bind us together polity Foreign aid logical outcome prosperous democratic culture threaten foreign aid quietly begin bring question humanism underpins culture Earlier today President Obama argued humanitarian intervention Syria invoking respect human dignity inherent American democratic culture arguing Our ideals principles well national security stake Syria Regardless relative merits humanitarian intervention notion ideals principles important
