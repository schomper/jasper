If poll punters sidelines junior footy Western Sydney anything go by Kevin Rudd faces uphill climb back popularity writes Michael Rowland The Janice Crosio Oval Smithfield Sydneys west may named popular former Labor minister affection ALP short supply recent junior footy day there As pint sized NRL stars future strutted stuff field parents turning minds big political fixture September 7 These people determine outcome string Western Sydney marginal seats ALP desperately needs cling chance staying power My extremely unscientific opinion poll bustling sidelines showed Kevin Rudd certainly work cut him Kieran Connaughton whos lived Blacktown eight years busily coordinating football games keeping eye charges St Anthonys Girraween Eagles under six team Kieran lives ALP held seat Greenway described swinging voter didnt mince words asked Australias 26th Prime Minister I dont trust him said I dont think many people do Changing elected leader twice doesnt sit well me I think getting back power rather things Footy mum Jackie Obeid equally low opinion Mr Rudd I dont like him Cant stand him He looks himself said Her disdain Prime Minister particularly strong extends sees handout mentality Australia The taxpayers paying parents Centrelink seven eight kids make divorced arent Were paying that said Tim Moggridge also lives Greenway said sitting fence stage written Kevin Rudd I think Kevin saleable voters Tony definitely isnt He doesnt seem get touch voters general public said For him biggest concern tenor political debate campaign People switching off tuning negative politics thats going on Its encouraging I certainly wouldnt want get politics given way treat other said On sidelines another game Geoff Cowling voter Liberal held seat Macquarie reckoned Coalition would walk in completely sold Tony Abbott I would probably prefer somebody different leading party Maybe Malcolm Turnbull vote put up said While great fan Prime Minister Kieran Connaughton said yet make mind vote frustrated focus national leaders When see local politicians seem repeating sound bites Rudd Abbott They pushed local issues thats shame need look local issues type election As Tony Abbott I think need see politicians Liberal Party If take Hockey Abbott away there I say name deputy Liberal leader I forget name well One pressing local issue Kieran Western Sydney traffic logjam I travel 10 kilometres work its gone 15 minute drive 25 minute drive last couple years thats purely large number people live here said So ABCs football focus group Kevin Rudd nose although people still arent sure Tony Abbott And voters sick negative politics Who needs Newspoll By way 100 per cent approval rating sausage sizzle Michael Rowland presented ABC News Breakfast since launch ABC News 24

dirty tricks lies manipulation backed considerable amount money its becoming truly ridiculous May People Australia stop think dont nobody hear scream help afterwards Alert moderator 16 Aug 2013 111704am The Liberal campaign time around shows signs utter desperation dirty tricks lies manipulation backed considerable amount moneyI thinking thing Labor party campaign is And given amount taxpayers money Obeid stole I think its reasonable say voter NSW contributed least dollars ALP stalwart sons Alert moderator 16 Aug 2013 21910pm Alpo better thisWhilst member ALP Eddie Obeid took upon himself little help friends deny NSW taxpayers tens millions dollars So see people think Eddie hands pockets NSW taxpayers You good recall may I remind Julia Gillard wanted focus scoreboard Well asylum seeker scoreboard showing 50000 Every boat policy failure The people western Sydney recognise everyone I speak to Kevin Rudd form bad form comes illegals It recently Kevin Rudd Bob Carr recognised asylum claims past been mostly false Although almost everyone knew claims based belief self determination immigration status Todays announcement Tony Abbott stop boats excellent news Although immigration continue past orderly manner I suspect voters right across country accept coalition policy announcement excellent means controlling borders A good result something Labor want dont ticker for So desperation Alpo common sense   something voters appreciate I suspect Alert moderator 16 Aug 2013 24117pm right lieskevins claims 70b 1 bil health jobs etc etc proved false factchecker

Give break Alert moderator 16 Aug 2013 110820am Because whole western Sydney one big share house swinging voters There many seats especially marginal ones close together makes efficient campaigningOver west west very very west Sydney candidates would need make least day trip 35   4h flight way 3 seats could possibly likely swing Hence neither party could really care WA Alert moderator 16 Aug 2013 112204am As someone originally regional NSW still visits relatives outside Sydney obvious Sydney important electorates Take poor sods Newcastle leasing port 700 million telling lucky government proposing sepnd 360 million thereThats like government selling house 900000 dollars telling luck I banking 50000 saleI agree NSW needs split two states state Sydney feeds financial services rorts state Outside Sydney actually produces something mining agriculture etc Alert moderator 16 Aug 2013 112241am Two reasons1 The population density Western Sydney get 12 seats similar demographics  local issues No region comes close2 So many 12 marginalThe combination means Western Sydney pretty much determines election outcome Alert moderator 16 Aug 2013 115653am Depending define Western Sydney youve got population larger Adelaide living   East Adelaide There number marginal seats must won held determine wins Government This also used safe Labor territory number reasons time changingThat said Western Sydney voter Im sick you were tripping media election time They forget us except theres shooting something next election Alert moderator 16 Aug 2013 124232pm Im sick

microcosm Australia reason whole lot could change hands electionBecause Sydneys population larger Australian cities substantial number Western Sydney seats whose electors similar demographically Here SYdney rich seats always vote Liberal Wentworth Cook North Shore seats always Labor seats filled hippies poor people inner west However lot swinging seats Western Suburbs urban fringeThere arent many Brisbane voters classes seem vote plolicy well class lines Melbourne where backward socialism seems thrivePerth Adelaide Hobart dont enough seats interestingAnd mother always says Australia either Sydney bush Alert moderator 16 Aug 2013 20540pm Simon I live Adelaide I name lots western Sydney suburbsAnd important many them You correct electorates roughly number voters But city 4 million people means electorates Sydney whole Western Australia South Australia Tasmania combined Alert moderator 16 Aug 2013 84330am Yeah thats pretty much feeling anywhere go across Sydney reallyTo Rudd looks tired bloated maybe health issues playing up He shop making half hearted announcement yesterday NT Hes lost mojo big time Alert moderator 16 Aug 2013 120847pm By token Abbott looks gaunt even emaciated health could questioned too However men appear quite healthy body What Mojo one lose it Perhaps meaningless word Alert moderator 16 Aug 2013 85138am It seems me course marriage thing nurturing children that You put special benefits package lasts 18 years takes put child community adult perhaps even retirement benefits In way becomes actual job rather label Too many people getting married children Is really marriage about I ask you Alert moderator 16 Aug 2013 124551pm Marriage mentioned hinted anywhere Mr Rowlands articlePerhaps youre saying Messrs Rudd  Abbotts policies close mays well married Alert moderator 16 Aug 2013 85934am Western Sydney divided race asking bunch white guys think may illuminating Several seats majority NESB would interesting see think Are engaged knowledgable Do vote primarily ethnic concerns broad outlook Political coverage pretends Australia white country millions NESB vote silent Why We cannot one community dont even know other Alert moderator 16 Aug 2013 125535pm What makes certain spectators junior rugby league match a bunch white guysSeems odd racist assumption makeRugby league especially western Sydney arguably racially diverse accepting sporting code Australia disproportionate involvement Indigenous Polynesian Melanesian Lebanese Australians The eastern suburbs north shore latte set may realise far fewer Indigenous Australians Redfern many western Sydney suburbs That Haymarket isnt centre Sydneys Chinese community That Bondi isnt Kiwi capital Sydney etc etc etc Alert moderator 16 Aug 2013 64024pm Hmmmmracially diverse Having swag races game doesnt make game diverse It means lots them As say disproportionate Football would probably win race players backgrounds European countries fair sprinkling Asia Middle EastGranted Aussie Rules smattering non Anglo surnamesAnd fuggedabout cricket Alert moderator 16 Aug 2013 10328pm Vote primarily race Yeah right That would explain Vietname Lebanese federal MPs Alert

broadcasts someVery savvy businessmen really Alert moderator 16 Aug 2013 94023am Michael I think tenuous link footy parents private school St Anthonys Girraween Eagles   doesnt sound like state school me general trend Western Sydney And even so one remarks Abbott touch average AustralianEven unscientific study its pretty long draw make selected statements refer Rudd nosePS Newspoll poor survey biased questions using landlines concentrating certain demographic generally small subset around 1000 generally wouldnt depend either Perhaps quality journalism ABC please Alert moderator 16 Aug 2013
