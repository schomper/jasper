<DOC_NAME>Ange Postecoglou to name Socceroos captain with Tim Cahill favoured to replace Lucas Neill</DOC_NAME>
<TEXT>
A month of speculation about Lucas Neills tenure as captain will end on Monday when new coach Ange Postecoglou names the Socceroos captain Postecoglou will announce the captain on Monday afternoon with Neill expected to be replaced by Tim Cahill No player has led Australia more than Neill who has captained the Socceroos on 60 occasions the same amount of matches that Peter Wilson led the nation in the 1970s But with Neill under pressure to retain his spot in the starting line up Postecoglou is understood to be considering Cahill who is certain to start in Tuesday nights friendly against Costa Rica in Sydney Neill faced calls to quit after uncertain defensive displays in the Socceroos recent consecutive 6 0 away defeats to Brazil and France The 35 year old has told of his desire to remain captain while another potential candidate Mark Bresciano has also said he would be honoured to be awarded the role But Brescianos future remains clouded by FIFA handing the midfielder a four month ban and 19 million fine for an illegal transfer between clubs in the United Arab Emirates and Qatar Bresciano and Football Federation Australia have vowed to fight the FIFA verdict but the uncertainty counts against his leadership ambitions Cahill 33 also has said he would be honoured to be appointed captain while maintaining that speculation about the position had not impacted on morale at the Socceroos training camp in Sydney It has got nothing to do with me  whatever the manager chooses to do whoever leads their country is going to do a great job and we have got some great leaders in this team Cahill said on Saturday Its a privilege to have your name in the mix but overall its not for me to pick a captain AAP Topicssocceroossoccersportaustralia
