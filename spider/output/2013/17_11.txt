<DOC_NAME>Australian musicians Last Dinosaurs, Sophie Koh look to emerging Asian market as domestic festivals falter</DOC_NAME>
<TEXT>
Australian musicians are increasingly turning to the emerging Asian touring market buoyed by enthusiastic crowds and good pay cheques as domestic festivals struggle Promoters are booking young Australian bands in clubs and festivals in Jakarta Singapore Bangkok Manila and Phnom Penh as well as cities across China While some acts are seeing the benefits of a market hungry for Western music others are learning the hard way that music does not always transcend cultural barriers The swing towards Asia in the music industry mirrors a more general geopolitical shift   what many have termed the Asian century or the Asian pivot And it comes as festivals in Australia struggle to stay afloat  Several major festivals including Homebake and Harvest were cancelled this year following poor ticket sales and a crowded festival market  Travelling festival the Big Day Out recently reduced the number of dates for its 2014 run cancelling a second Sydney show  For Melbourne singer Sophie Koh a recent 14 date tour of mainland China saw her play to some of the most enthusiastic audiences of her career It was fantastic she said Ive never been I have no back story in China but people actually came to see us every night We went to a lot of university towns and a lot of the kids take a punt and actually come to the venue regardless of whos playing  She said it was a huge difference from audiences in Melbourne which can be more reserved Over in China people are up the front from the start they are singing along by the second song and they really get into it Village Sounds the company that co produces Splendour In The Grass Homebake and Falls Festival recently signed a deal with a Singapore based touring agency to get more Australian acts touring Asia  Village Sounds co director Evan Davis said his acts   particularly Brisbane group Last Dinosaurs who this month play Kuala Lumpur and Manila   have been blown away by the response Obviously its such a growing market and its right on Australias doorstep so its something we had looked into Mr Davis told ABC Online   After seeing the shows and seeing the reception that the guys got in Singapore and Bangkok theres a definitely a hunger for it  He said social media was driving a huge interest in Australian musicians  The band did a press call on the Tuesday and there was hundreds of under 18 girls there who had found Last Dinosaurs through online media Mr Davis said  Before their Singapore show the band was swamped by fans asking for autographs and photos  The following day they played to 3000 people who sung along to every song  The Laneway Festival which is held in cities across Australia expanded to Singapore two years ago and Mr Davis said he expects interest from the region in Australian acts to grow He also said while the pay for touring acts is comparable to Australia overhead costs such as accommodation and transport are lower  But the push toward Asia does not always work out as planned Brisbane band Dune Rats were booked to play a festival in Vietnam before organisers discovered the video for their song Red Light Green Light  The clip which has over 300000 hits on YouTube is not subtle the members are shown trying to smoke as much marijuana as possible  Whats acceptable in certain countries is certainly not acceptable in others   To my understanding the Vietnamese government saw a video that Dune Rats had put up and they obviously didnt agree with it so they asked that they not come in Mr Davis whose colleague at Village Sounds works with the band said Whats acceptable in certain countries is certainly not acceptable in others Its something that is quite unique to these ventures when you start going into these markets Festival spokesperson Giles Cooper told TheMusiccomau in September that the clip was a factor in the band being removed from the line up We love Dune Rats music and we are sorry not to be hosting them here this time Mr Cooper told the site  You have to understand the environment were operating in  its not the easiest for promoting live international music unfortunately and we all want to be able to do more events Ms Koh said before she arrived in China she had to submit her lyrics and video footage of previous performances to be vetted by the authorities  Topicsarts and entertainmentmusicbusiness economics and financeindustrymusic industryaustraliaasiapacific     First posted           November 17 2013 180456

<DOC_NAME>Italy's Silvio Berlusconi hits out at defectors after party split</DOC_NAME>
<TEXT>
Italys Silvio Berlusconi has hit out at former loyalists in his centre right party who have set up a renewal faction led by the media tycoons ex protege Angelino Alfano The billionaire former prime minister blamed the split without ever naming Mr Alfano on differences not of policy or values but between personalities who have created a poisonous atmosphere Mr Alfano who announced the divorce after late night talks on Friday stayed away along with some 50 other defectors from a meeting on Saturday of Mr Berlusconis People of Freedom PDL party During a rambling speech lasting an hour and a half the scandal tainted Mr Berlusconi 77 drew frequent applause Admitting to having had a sleepless night once appearing on the verge of fainting before recovering himself the media and construction baron expressed his sadness at the break up  In a conciliatory gesture Mr Berlusconi added however that Mr Alfanos grouping would be a necessary member of the 200 strong centre right voting bloc The PDL meeting was meant to be a happy event at which the party would be rebaptised Forza Italia Go Italy the sporty name Mr Berlusconi used when he first launched the party in 1994 Mr Alfano whose faction is to be called the New Centre Right said his decision had been very bitter painful but fair The 43 year old Sicilian lawyer told a news conference It was unthinkable for us to throw the country into a situation that would have further aggravated things for Italians He said on Friday he would not be part of the reborn Forza Italia because these past few weeks have shown to what extent extreme forces have prevailed within our movement referring to a belief by his supporters that Mr Berlusconi was pandering to hardliners Mr Berlusconis party has been in turmoil since September when he tried to bring down Italys uneasy left right coalition government by withdrawing his ministers but was forced into a humiliating climbdown when they refused to heed his orders The five ministers   all Alfano supporters   will stay on as members of the rump PDL meaning that Forza Italia will not be represented in the government The daily La Stampa described the break up as the first post Berlusconi act with an immediate consequence The government is saved with a new smaller but also more united parliamentary majority Mr Berlusconi will face another humiliation on November 27 when the Senate votes whether to eject him from parliaments upper chamber under a law banning convicted criminals from the body Italys supreme court on August 1 turned down Mr Berlusconis final appeal in a tax fraud case handing him his first ever definitive conviction in a long history of legal woes AFP Topicsworld politicsgovernment and politicsitaly     First posted           November 17 2013 063207
