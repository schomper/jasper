government deservedly lost Kevin Rudd Labor 2007 federal election Right end Howard government competent efficient Notwithstanding Peter Costellos frustrated leadership ambitions remained united disciplined team Its policy economic legacies coveted Rudd positively embraced then self described economic conservative But Howard government deserved lose 2007 demonstrated reason seek re election say look record dont trust Labor Howard team including current prime ministerial aspirant Tony Abbott couldnt convince enough Australians meaningful reason retaining office held it They simply offered same Rudd fresh alternative seemed safe bet good economic times Unsurprisingly enough swinging voters dismissed Howard government past it Fast forward 2013 At half way point election campaign messages major parties crystallised Abbotts Coalition hammers divided incompetent destructive Labor government must go now Like Howard 2007 resurrected Rudd counters Abbott wins Australians lose Paul Keatings political mentor Jack Lang famously asserted In race life always back self interest   least know its trying Thats major party policy announcements assume question voters minds whats me As Chris Berg noted The Drum week Coalition Labor steadily rolling big small micro election policy spending commitments tick many self interest boxes   especially hotly contested marginal seats decide outcome These range Coalitions paid parental leave scheme Labors hang Holden car plan local scout hall sporting facility upgrades This potentially change government election changing government truly changes

political power prestige high office realise vision What higher principles values guide him How translate shaping social economic foreign policy drive Australias economy society place world next three years possibly next three decades And Kevin Rudd Since regaining Labor leadership June Rudd offered little evidence hes used wilderness years reflect shaping Australia future opposed own Eschewing policy achievements vanquished Julia Gillard especially Gonski education funding reforms National Disability Insurance Scheme Rudd reduced throwing money problems thrown Labors pollsters focus groups Like Howard 2007 however so called master campaigner offering coherent justification another term Labor beyond simply stoking fear Abbott Yet millions Australians yearning direction vision leadership big issues matter common future Take immigration one example Stopping human misery leaky boats overloaded desperate asylum seekers tops political agenda its become part immigration challenge matters In past three years much meaningful debate many migrants accept many needed support ageing populations standard living long term population growth sustain finite natural resources best economic skills family migration mix nation In truth almost none Governing done prose election campaigns speak poetry They eloquent contests ideas higher purposes values give context policies funding commitments Voters want politicians vision make Australia children inherit happier healthier kinder prosperous want know leaders values beliefs guide govern Above all want inspiration   especially last three turgid political years With Peoples Forum debate Brisbane tonight Coalitions Labors centrepiece policy launches coming next week Rudd Abbott golden opportunities reframe election terms higher aspirations values beliefs They bash side re announce big ticket items tell us something drives them theyll lead theyll try change world better Above all give us confidence vote trust judgment As John
