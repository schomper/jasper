In recent New York Times op ed ANU scientist Roger Bradbury writes Its past time tell truth state worlds coral reefs He argues coral reefs largely zombie ecosystems beyond hope gone within generation According Bradbury scientists conservationists governments recently signed declaration coming International Coral Reef Symposium held Cairns airbrushing truth He states general reluctance face scientific evidence there hope saving global coral reef ecosystem The causes Bradbury clearly sees imminent extinction worldwide coral reefs overfishing ocean acidification pollution He points processes accelerating even immediate action little prospect changing trajectory anything less 20 50 years Thus destruction reefs unstoppable irreversible For Bradbury raises issue allocation funds deal fallout ecological collapse The suggestion stop wasting resources saving reefs redirect efforts concentration towards reefs gone encouraging ecosystems might replace reefs preserving genetic materials examining kind economic structural adjustment necessary poorer communities dependent reefs Among responded Bradburys piece general agreement extreme crisis reefs extent already late many If havent caught this ongoing coverage makes alarming reading Consider face species loss collapse entire ecosystem The responses also reveal however reluctance accept central point piece give hope reefs Ben Eltham writing New Matilda example points ray hope recent implementation carbon tax Presumably kind airbrushing Bradbury concerned reject little late Bradbury clearly regards line crossed argues need strategy one based hope reefs Bradburys piece also elicited flurry responses scientists reveal least debate whether actually hope They generally argue situation dire urgent line supposedly
