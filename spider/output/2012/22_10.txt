falling scraping knee Come on The inquest also looked question carries Taser heard standard practice one two officers partnered one shift carry weapon Given PC carried five Taser applications Curti ground Coroner could recommend always senior officer carries stun gun Lawyers NSW police raised logistical concerns rule ever imposed The police however already flagged changes Officers top spent two weeks arguing every use Taser Roberto Laudisio Curti justified Yet almost face last day inquest senior legal representative Bruce Hodgkinson SC told court procedures already changed reflect issues raised court Hodgkinson spoke clear need certain terms clarified direction given officers Taser use particularly drive stun mode Will changes suffice Given testimony junior senior officers refused concede taken step wrong hard much confidence fundamental changes procedures training likely be In regard 2008 report NSW Ombudsman Taser use makes sobering reading Many concerns Bruce Barbour raised

Curti LSD induced psychotic state behaving extremely erratically one point leaping secure caged area convenience store The truth many people find receiving end Taser possible exception poor Farmer England vulnerable psychological state may already extremely fearful police This presents conundrum officers alleged offenders unlikely respond rationally police requests Yet Laudisio Curti case tragically demonstrates may also respond force The resisted force applied That vicious circle ended death young man loving family much live for Given significant issues highlighted inquest may worth re visiting proposal put forward NSW Ombudsman 2008 report kind moratorium placed Tasers This Ombudsman noted time would allow police time upgrade training relevant policies accountability measures

Police using gun rather device subdue unarmed person running awayme thinks Police treat deployment gun deployed hold independent inquiry deployed found deployment unlawful Officer concerned charged Alert moderator 22 Oct 2012 102619am Tasers should used way firearms   is treated potentially lethal weapon used choice availableUnfortunately many people law enforcement seem think less lethal weapon convenient short cut day to day activities Until Police organisations start train officers treat Tasers like slightly less lethal firearm rather non lethal weapon and decidedly NOT non lethal I cannot see we Public trust devices Alert moderator 22 Oct 2012 110223am Thats way used its obvious arent They used compliance device Alert moderator 22 Oct 2012 83727pm Trouble stating using taser get compliance including drive stun mode perfectly acceptable   son daughter incapacitated pensioner Remind exactly protection us unfettered Police brutality Maybe someone take Police civil suit maybe might win even though unlawfulness Maybe would wake pollies Police Commissioner using LETHAL weapon treated such Alert moderator 22 Oct 2012 122814pm As statistic tasers far safer form physical restraint forceAs result tasers perfect first response police enforce compliance The alternatives would batons OC spray physical take down All alternatives higher risk complications physical injuryCurrently Australian police supposed use tasers defensive weapon This gross misuse device represents policy based political factors instead practical onesThe truth A taser isnt designed defend you Its single shot prone misfire becomes useless bit plastic hit targets clothes Against man knife even determined unarmed man youd want something better A taser designed incapacitate person place complete control taser barb removed It clearly compliance device used accordingly Alert moderator 22 Oct 2012 11103pm OrlyA taser designed incapacitate person place complete control taser barb removed Judging case I think taser use failedI understand police operate often dangerous circumstances support police using force appropriate However weapon used risk life limb real immenent andor offence warrants risk removed society Almost weapon use excessive force potentially fatal One problems tasers person underlying condition police knowledge ofIn case unarmed stole couple packets biscuits He running away little threat anyone except maybe police chasing him Offence small   risk community small The taser or weapon used let alone repeatedly Alert moderator 22 Oct 2012 15727pm In case unarmed stole couple packets biscuits He running away little threat anyone except maybe police chasing himThe thread relating taser policy general specific event But lets consider argument We individual running away police resisting arrest committing crime And top that hes suffering psychotic episode which makes threat society needs dealt with A man running away poses threat police But community expects man arrested law enforced So arrest then taser Tackle pavement Strike baton Set police dog him All alternative means far risky would potentially injure kill himShould police chase half hour hope gets tired Send twenty or thirty more police officers try corner potentially armed individual Let escape hope doesnt commit anymore crimes Too inefficientAt end day using taser effective least dangerous way bringing enforcing law And thus taser preferred tool arrestIn case suspect died Thats undoubtably tragic its law averages And given investigation findings tasers werent cause death anyway Since died suffocation would think capsicum spray lungs police pinning far likely relevent factors If anything argument favor using tasers Had police relied taser means arresting him probably would still alive Alert moderator 22 Oct 2012 23036pm  All alternative means far risky would potentially injure kill himI sure I remember particulars case correctly I think person assaulted taser die Alert moderator 22 Oct 2012 74737pm Early professional prepared stick neck suggested positional asphyxia cause Curtis death rather tasers I agree though reasons continuing taser guy cuffed obscure Sounded like punishment torture anything else Dont know whether Ive strayed sub judice here Alert moderator 22 Oct 2012 23657pm pray tell time tasers The cops managed jobs without reliance devices These days seem crap hanging belts Batman Alert moderator 22 Oct 2012 31000pm Not impressed arguments here Orly As Ombudsman pointed out multi faceted problem requiring nuanced solutions varied responsesWe individual running away police resisting arrest committing crime And top that hes suffering psychotic episode which makes threat society needs dealt with Ok hes running away arrest stealing two packets biscuits It would obvious fairly early police either drugs mentally unstable Either way limitations capacity respond police requests Thats possible point favor initial taseringSecond evidence situation life threatening He didnt knife seek attack police ran awayThird I find hard believe needed multiple tasering ground This goes back first point police considered man drugs mentally ill tasering get sit quietly going produce compliance The multiple police pile ons also operationally questionableThis like old Vietnam war story destroy village order save it Police longer engage high speed car pursuits past certain point know outcome generally worse letting offender get away They need similar harm minimization standards use tasers especially person disabled drugs mental illness immediate threat others Alert moderator 22 Oct 2012 35953pm Kenji The points raise already addressed comments All I ask read againThere good reason enforcement law compromised individual might mentally ill high drugs Alert moderator 22 Oct 2012 65014pm Orly I assure I read fully understood arguments I rejected failed adequately address issues mental illness drugs protests notwithstanding Applying law averages hardly nuanced effective policy Developing specific harm minimization methods is Alert moderator 22 Oct 2012 73546pm KenjiI would say arguments address issues raised protests notwithstanding And unless feel like addressing specific parts post I dont see productive reason replying further Alert moderator 22 Oct 2012 71044pm Orly police compromise law enforcement time interest greater good For example An unstable gunman holding spouse child hostage    10 hr wait far preferable shoot multiple dead Dropping number criminal charges order obtain guilty pleas key charges Providing indemnity criminal accomplices giving evidence organized crime drug trafficking Traffic police let people warnings instead prosecution Police going shoot armed gunman fleeing crowded shopping mall shootingIn resisting assault citizens must ensure responses legal necessary proportionate Police must give similar considerations actions protecting society  The current death drug affected biscuit stealer case point Unless life another person threatened way death absolutely serious policing failure Society better Alert moderator 22 Oct 2012 75544pm Kenj Curti seemed particularly sensitive LSD He psychotic getting progressively worse I dont think cops could left continue way due risks harm possibly others lawfully possession biscuits product may sudden craving for They intervene But sounds like executed intervention badly I hope none officers involved overcompensated lack bulk fitness going mad taser capsicum spray suspect did Very sad involved especially Curti family Alert moderator 22 Oct 2012 100101pm The things list assertions examples Alert moderator 23 Oct 2012 83739am Assertion a positive statement declaration often without support reasonI suppose thats mean say Of course claims I refer overwhelming factual basis Read newspaper examples Alert moderator 24 Oct 2012 120304am Hmmm enforcement laws shocking otherwise compliant low threat people electric shocks sounds like oxymoron me Water boarding next Afterall threat deathThis really bad getting worse Alert moderator 24 Oct 2012 23238pm enforcement laws shocking otherwise compliant low threat people electric shocks sounds like oxymoron meAre aware oxymoron meansEnforcement law its definition requires deployment force resist it If people compliant law doesnt need enforced themThe people issue who whatever reason dont like idea laws enforced Im sure given choice theyd prefer anarchy police all Alert moderator 22 Oct 2012 43843pm kenji Police longer engage high speed car pursuits past certain point I would like think rightWE always hear smash following police pursuit chase given crashI dont think hear chase discontinuedlike long accident WE also never hear ones got awayafter chase called offOf course information maybe reports releasedof releasedreporters cannot bothered report them Alert moderator 23 Oct 2012 103320pm What requires decent policing The first response reach weapon idea 55 kg beat police absolute bloody joke As knives stuff Christ I high school teachers would taken down  training training trainingA little story I LAX 30 years ago 2YO daughter little kids room She playing I semi comatose leaning giant 1m play block An LAPD police woman put head told I could lean block I bit bemused said Pardon huh quite politely Her response hand gun barked command THAT kind policing risk rubbish Alert moderator 22 Oct 2012 41442pm OrlyYes community expects police enforce law But I noted earlier level force used uphold law needs relevant offence The resources used event significant Does community expect level police activity person steals dollars worth food A couple centuries ago may resulted transportation one colonies Todays expectations bit realisticBy upholding law instance caused death individual committed minor offence The costs associated managing legal fallout political fallout etc expensive Definitely worth couple packets biscuits As I stated earlier I police using necessary force uphold law level force resources used relative level crime Alert moderator 22 Oct 2012 44604pm But I noted earlier level force used uphold law needs relevant offenceI would disagree Police use force enforce law punish offenders Thus level force relation crime allegedly committed Rather force proportional level resistance given suspectIf gunman drops gun surrenders arrested without force If petty shoplifter runs police force used stop him The issue packet biscuits The issue act non compliance Alert moderator 23 Oct 2012 122959pm Thus level force relation crime allegedly committed Rather force proportional level resistance given suspectIn words subdue capture cost   even may cause serious injury death Why introduced policies around high speed chases Because risk injury great worth effort capturing thief What value Orly   property people Alert moderator 24 Oct 2012 24103pm RonYour example flawed The police stop high speed chases risk innocent bystanders The risk offender isnt usually point consideration In cases innocent people harmed police usually deploy spike strips blow offenders tyres In cases might physically ram offenders car roadAs I said before The level force depend level resistance crime itself Alert moderator 22 Oct 2012 43016pm The man stole couple biscuitsand ran awayWhoopee One would thought police found unarmedhad stolen two packs biscuitsthey allowed wander back Police Stationand something usefulThat way more must results 1 robberyof store2 packets biscuits taken The side sheet1

result harm  like believing invulnerable leaping building traffic others may taken custody safety Alert moderator 23 Oct 2012 85342am You sound like work Taser manufacturer Law averages Just bit bad luck NOT good enough I glad opinions majority Alert moderator 23 Oct 2012 123626pm Law averages Just bit bad luck NOT good enough I glad opinions majorityNot good enough you perhapsBut majority opinion almost issue apathy People care law efficient enforced They dont care 0001 case LSD psychotic ends dead accident resisted arrestCheck statistics They speak themselves Tasers safest means arrest thus preferred means arrest It isnt rocket science Alert moderator 24 Oct 2012 33629pm I agree check statistics LSD one safest drugs actually psilosiben magic mushrooms safest What I worried deadly biscuits becoming Alert moderator 23 Oct 2012 90239pm Yes Police need able use force arresting someone yes tasers generally effective compliance tool There two problems however 1 Tasers never sold compliance tool rather alternative firearms The debate taser use compliance happened needs happen Tasers compliance discontinued occured 2 Tasers compliance invariable led abuse You argue much greater risk alternative compliance measures reason Tasers deployed complacency Every time officer deploys force needs thinking vary carefully consequences force A baton tackle better use due obvious effects apllication accountability comes that This human nature Tasers lead abuse due ease use general lack physical effects Alert moderator 24 Oct 2012 61452pm You narrow focused descriptions police could doneEfficiency key argument one plain clothed officer observe surveil mission Follows home waits suspects mental state subside lay appropriate charges Easy might involve patience warrant enter premises told death cheaper enquire police get full fill violence addiction Alert moderator 25 Oct 2012 74542am Orly I wonder would feel member family The police involved must held account Police

genuine interests protecting public absolutely bloody reason repeatedly taser someone unarmed handcuffedThe use tasers here certainly restrained nothing compliance everything violent assault criminal opinion policeThe police action case absolutely disgraceful repugnant abuse authority Alert moderator 23 Oct 2012 91940am Exactly right Evidentlyi The police clearly see necessary part detention process detainee reduced state passive docility Where mental illness drugs involved unlikely occur without seriously assaulting person ways arent necessary detention process What disturbing police mindset There nuance graded response We dont accept arresting police throw pregnant women ground understand harm occur There needs similar protocols training dealings mentally ill drug affected

responsible taking LSD cops still responsible reacted erratic behaviour Remember Curtis crime stealing biscuits I believe reasonable make dramatic attempts subdue biscuit thief dies process Liberal MP Mary Jo Fisher shoplifted whilst apparently suffering psychotic episode She even assaulted security guard whereas Curti assault anyone The authorities managed deal Fisher without killing her mistake Curti seems clearly avoidable Alert moderator 24 Oct 2012 122034pm Batman I also somewhat leery internet anecdotes I mention situation elicit sympathy pity neither I need want try make point persons

line thinking It chaos everywhere big time Alert moderator 22 Oct 2012 95040am When Tasers introduced whole point police could protect people without shooting them Good idea If point tasers police use anyone like time fine make law society accept outcomesThe rules engagement use Tasers need clear If police officer breaks rules charged like guns I great admiration difficult work Police do clearly follow rules They face consequencesAnd cover up culture needs stop hardest thing achieve Alert moderator 22 Oct 2012 40040pm Part problem Tazer corporation goes way legally cover product call weapon non lethal despite fact causes quite lethalities business relies distinctionThey legal representation inquest like every inquest manslaughter case tazer used relation victims death sole purpose legal representation steer courts away declaring tazers deadly weapon Alert moderator 22 Oct 2012 95048am The reason police pursuing taken two packets biscuits convenience store Thats misleading The reason police pursuing ran away challenged The reason challenged stole biscuits erratic behaviour Im guessing police would pursue anyone runs away lawful questioning It turned later behaving erratically due an LSD induced psychotic state police couldnt sure cause behaviour timeThat said I cant see reason tazer someone already handcuffed therefore control Alert moderator 22 Oct 2012 95833am He chased

thuggery tolerated action Police Officers Alert moderator 22 Oct 2012 111738am Unlike author contributors Ill reserve value judgements coroner hands findings Its easy simplify potentially confusing challenging situations Particularly light quality media coverage types events usually receive Alert moderator 22 Oct 2012 114721am Actually River drugs personal responsibility precisely story about If individual concerned used drugs committed robbery would still alive Did police overreact there ever position tried subdue drunk drugged junkie someone day decided commit offence I lot easier sit armchair home criticise do If choice letting offender walk away force may used apprehend use force arrest him police officers sworn duty latter Alert moderator 22 Oct 2012 21404pm And young man stayed bed day hed still alive too There long chain events taking LSD responsibleapprehend use force arrest him police officers sic sworn duty latter Sure But talking HOW force applied For example hitting suspect head brick correctly called force wouldnt agree cops use tacticor would we Alert moderator 22 Oct 2012 41520pm In case yes case mentioned article   old blind man Tazered police officer behind officer mistook cane katana   failing exercise personal responsibility thereThere plenty incidents police officers misusing tazers people innocent crime cry consequences afterwardsA classic example Perth officer ended suffering brain damage beaten sons man using tazer despite fact man tazered nothing wrong The court found sons innocent grievous bodily harm charges reason self defense due officer assaulted father weapon despite provoked found partner escalated situation hitting one sons baton tried stop him Yet despite fact officers assaulted man sons never got charged assault In fact police union giant cry demanded mandatory sentences anyone assaults police officer which obviously wouldnt helped case unless demanding mandatory sentences people get found guilty well guilty giant cry hard done two cops started collecting donations themWhere taking personal responsibility story Oh thats right police officers never take responsibility actions   demand everyone else Alert moderator 22 Oct 2012 105919am Recreational drug use except everyones favourite alcohol already illegal context article pointAnd comes personal responsibility applied police situation There seems obvious application force one man many police When police involved accept personal responsibility time call enough event admit let things get hand I dont know proud Force poorly trained number police cant restrain one young man without serious injury Alert moderator 22 Oct 2012 14851pm At least one reasonable point publicly known facts point likely primary cause Curtis death Curti took LSD No matter nice person Curti may behaving erratically unpredictably He commit robbery hindsight interpreted behaviour relatively benign public While would nice police could handle situations ridiculous expect police perfectThe application force circumstances seem obvious all I reserve judgementThen much tax personally prepared pay better trained police force Alert moderator 22 Oct 2012 22428pm only hindsight interpreted behaviour relatively benign publicOther jump counter shop could said young man threat anyone else We careful dont start allowing police arrest detain indeed injure someone based person might do God help us unpredictable becomes crimeMy understanding police use firearm unless life immediate danger tasers meant used within parameters Alert moderator 22 Oct 2012 34046pm Other  good

22 Oct 2012 100116am I underestimated difficult job police officer stresses involved They extremely difficult job first port call something goes wrong However something need done this There vast number cases stress particular situation police made poor judgement calls There recent case mentally ill man NSW shot dead police loose truth incident Often police sharpest knives drawer training obviously needs modifying How anyone could think tasering someone fourteen times appropriate beyond me Police UK far greate level respect dont carry weapons I bobby Manchester help carry Christmas shopping car I believe police one shot tasers I believe training better I believe full force law come break law Its impossible put te position police Cronulla riot style situation putting position family Taser victim also difficult imagine I hope Brazilian victims family receive millions compensation Its sad affair cant keep happening Alert moderator 22 Oct 2012 114956am Without attempting judge case I want point One shot Tasers may end result death police officer misses first time There reason bullets used police hollow nosed Once fired intended kill disable permit offender able shoot backYou try things like shooting lethal parts body mind officers killed instead criminals Alert moderator 22 Oct 2012 100440am This clear assault resulted death Using force proportionate threat presented definition assault How justify using taser anyone handcuffed beyond meWe see over police admit mistakes culture protecting other even clear cases misuse often goes way topIts time demanded police service not force meets community expectations protect harmWhen deadly weapons used manner police must accountable via charges Alert moderator 22 Oct 2012 114718am Its time demanded police service not force meets community expectations protect harmThats good point I wonder protected tasering handcuffed man Alert moderator 22 Oct 2012 123436pm duncan need get facts straight far coroner found taser use anything death assault call NOT result death secondly police protect whole community I encourage research police protect community day night rather forming opinion one unfortunate incident and completely biased representation media completely responsibility police Alert moderator 22 Oct 2012 45838pm The tasers werent cause death contribute it You arguing like force used proportional Using 3 cans capsicum spray tasering repeatedly pinning limiting ability breathe handcuffed many police officers top caused death The police killed needs independent investigation Honestly needs independent investigations every case involving police officer They shown cannot trusted investigate other Alert moderator 22 Oct 2012 55424pm Matt Im curious ever subdue person drug induced psychotic episode Or someone fighting drunk mentally ill capable reasoned with In former occupation I many times proven tactics used minimise chance injury one tactics go many people available swarm person say 3 cans capsicum spray used obvious working person happens particularly drug induced violent episodes The could probable said tazers In perfect world none would necessary far perfect police best someone accidentally die thats reality Anyway instead braying police blood arent braying blood scumbag sold LSD Alert moderator 22 Oct 2012 73108pm Matt know tasers kill him Where evidence And yes I agree capsicum spray excessive force restraint bad contributors too Read text Would people die precise moment without use taser Alert moderator 22 Oct 2012 13213pm Its time demanded

I dont mean oh everybody knows type way would empirically know systemic manipulation facts policeWas force excessive hindsight Perhaps Did officers benefit hindsight NoThey dealing man midst psychotic

enduced psychotic episode reason police needed subdue him stolen biscuits approached shoplifting thats relevance biscuits ends Alert moderator 22 Oct 2012 100916am We told tasers compliance tool non lethal method protect police community self defence If appropriate draw firearm given situation also appropriate used taser tasers increasingly used lazy policing expecially since seems consequences police use multiple times cause deaths Alert moderator 22 Oct 2012 123601pm evidence tasers increasingly used lazy policing Alert moderator 22 Oct 2012 101417am A person dead died due actions police surrounding him He arrest duty care protect anyone custodySomeone better charged manslaughter Alert moderator 22 Oct 2012 105253am sorry someone us would prefer live police state whether live die

stone wall try reverse onus proof Alert moderator 22 Oct 2012 111251am RolandSpeed cameras killYour first comment simplistic taken logic conclusion would mean anyone runs amok killed Not people would expect humane society Tasers effective police tool provided used correctly Tasering someone handcuffs 14 times appear correct use Perhaps indicative zealous police force Alert moderator 22 Oct 2012

problem lies mob mentality might take subduing prisoner become team sport rather particular intentional action part individual officers involved Mob mentality well known often results brutal actions would never happen individuals acting alone Why assume Police exempt form excitability It really question danger I convinced tasers always used properly police always behave perfectly I would rather using tasers blasting away guns like American movie Regardless outcome I imagine persons death circumstances done international image favours Alert moderator 22 Oct 2012 102440am This seems like ridiculous overkill police The guy stole 2 packets biscuits goodness sake But even police considered danger public firmly control safely arrest Why taser continually used Police must held accountable

death compared tasersAre classes people tasers contra indicated Of course The sick elderly course greater risk complications affected psychoactive drugsBut then people also greater risk shot firearmsThere class group people safer shot firearm rather taserFor genuine weapons duress ie nonlethal police equipped various grades peppersprays better batons They also far reliable economicalYoure wrong here I regret Pepper sprays sometimes work well people respiratory conditions far higher risk adverse effects people subject restraining techniques restrict breathing passages Pepper spray also classed less lethal weaponBatons also risks even used correctly In modern usage protocols strikes obvious vulnerable parts head throat sternum spine groin barred However strikes limbs targetting
