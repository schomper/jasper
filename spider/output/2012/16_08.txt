outMaybe Mr Turnbull could become first independent PM certainly shares little coalition Alert moderator 16 Aug 2012 61142pm One thing Robert Hughes provided me insight art culture regardless whether right wrong style I intrigued interested things I hadnt interested beforeYes I believe seem ruled bogan mentality judging standard schooling South Australia I safely say wont change hurry except maybe get worse Its fairly obvious we country respect admire chefs footy players scientists artists Im saying chefs footy players dont deserve admiration seem somewhat lopsided I wont even go seems belief someone actually knows something scientific less believe them conversely less someone knows believe themOne thing highlighted differences culture unnamed European country I talking colleagues forthcoming work related relocation said European country I cant take much stuff Im trying work I take I said My Australian colleagues quite seriously told I take TV AFL football My European colleagues said books course The latter made sense me former seemed like joke wasnt All people I talked similar age education levelsThe gradual erosion skills required critical thinking new ideas general open ended discourse topic occurring years push in SA least turn Universities vocational training centres rather places people go study subjects actually interested in maybe go research sortWe arent approaching slippery slope towards becoming predominantly docile ignorant ill educated nation unless involves AFL NRL stats solely focussed getting bare minimum education able perform specific job already sliding it Alert moderator 16 Aug 2012 64222pm Thanks Jonathan good article It possible national character may already changing  although slowly The next Federal election great test

judge harshly Alert moderator 16 Aug 2012 100145pm Two things worry article Firstly allusions intellectual nobility sound terribly 18th century finely crafted critical thinking somehow attribute aristocratic privilege Secondly rhetorical contrast Institute Sport Institute Thought misses point completely contemporary role public commentators like Robert Hughes many othersAs art critic Hughes exceptionally good journalist I mean seriously He 18th century thinker kind many university people would still dearly wish be His knowledge base product art history department lived experience As art writer never seemed interested plaudits refereed journals trappings academic life Rather sought secured popular audience kept entertained many decades writing careerHis public role nominally influential highly restricted Instead pushing new horizons Hughes spent decades employ famous highly formulaic current affairs magazine That magazine doubt retained could turn quick copy considerable flair His snazzy turns phrase sense big picture desire infuse basic populism something pretending towards higher sensibilty made kind Paul Keating modern art criticism A cheeky rough and tumble verbaliserI putting Hughes down On contrary I applaud role created outside frameworks institutionalised cultural thought Getting back Institute Sport   opposite kettle fish Our elite sports industry become new ivory tower wholly institutionalised endeavour need challenge reinvention without Sport like art needs real characters arent afraid tread different path Alert moderator 16 Aug 2012 102355pm
