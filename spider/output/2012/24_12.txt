grow years Soon anything puts green shoot devoured wallabies turned areas lush bushland wasteland sand said The Houtman Abrolhos network islands 80 kilometres west Geraldton sit heart states rock lobster industry caters small number tourists The Department Fisheries responsible managing A Class reserve taking advice tackle situation number agencies The department says recommended cull wallabies North Island stop population explosion Its Mid West regional manager Ron Shepherd says Department Environment Conservation advised professional shooting trapping wallabies The wallaby

departments ongoing A timeline yet set proposed cull DEC yet issue damage licence authorise it A DEC spokesperson says wallabies damaging islands flora fauna Based evidence surveys known Tammar wallabies overgrazing damaging habitat species native island said The introduced wallabies particularly impacted Abrolhos Island button quail threatened species The DEC issued Fisheries damage licences wallaby culls North Island past Throughout 2007 2008 series culls took place contraceptive implant program deemed unsuccessful A senior lecturer University Sydney PhD marsupial reproduction Dr Catherine Herbert took part program The contraceptives worked individual level able inhibit reproduction females treated said The problem totally under estimated magnitude problem key issue that outset stakeholders hadnt resolved clear goal population Dr Herbert says implants appeared working population booming quickly effective One issues fertility control theres always lag period starting its like culling go get immediate drop number said You basically wait females infertile Dr Herbert says population flared implanting contraceptives food grew scarce animals There definitely animal welfare issue time average body weight 2005 2006 2007 steadily dropping quite significantly said So something needed done clear contraceptives alone werent job The Conservation Council WAs Nic Dunlop says clear animals need removed island The question were asking looking culling removal asked What method culling proposed And whether were going make good use species extinct major parts mainland possible relocation projects mainland nature reserves national parks The DEC says continual inbreeding island wallabies suitable re introduce mainland many would survive long term Dr Herbert says wallaby population derived small number animals poor genetic variation She says genetic variation important populations ability adapt new changes If new disease comes through theres less chance youve got appropriate genes respond disease youre susceptible catastrophic events said Dr Herbert says wallabies natural predators North Island makes prone attack re located opposed wallabies Abrolhos islands She says though its risky sometimes translocation work You cant say wouldnt survive thats correct said For example North Island population started five animals survived perfectly well last 25 years There lots different wild animals small number introduced somewhere theyve flourished couple hundred years Mr Dunlop says animals lost translocation would certainly less numbers lost culling process If youre talking culling theyre going die anyway I dont quite see point line argument against translocation said Mr Dunlop says DEC already translocates animals places like Barrow Island mainland Theres risk involved animals well which may may higher Tammars I dont know I think appropriate resources directed could probably get quite reasonable outcome said I think real question theyre proposing may whats cheapest whats best Fisheries says number options discussed yet revealed alternatives culling Dr Herbert says island heavily overpopulated real options culling translocation She says end day wellbeing animals priority You need whats best animals population getting high theyre getting low food youre getting point either disease starvation end taking lot animals said Rock lobster fisherman Terry Mouchemore says culling emotive issue people need understand impact animals North Island I believe everyone frequents North Island believes cull necessary said People see wallabies cute furry little things bouncing around looks great go sit back see long term effect stability island You must remember its sand island remove vegetation its prone erosion cant let happen
