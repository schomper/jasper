Germany effectively operate foreign currency Euro To liken state finances household outputs must met equivalent inputs liken Australian public debt situation Greece demonstrate fundamental misunderstanding government finance sovereign fiat currency is In Australia currency enters circulation federal public spending credits private accounts   individuals business state governments who also users currency rather issuers households Taxation doesnt fund public expenditure federal level rather serves establish maintain value imprimatur currency operates lever dampen private spending Taxation calling issued money effectively destroying it A progressive taxation system therefore expressly designed much means redistribution rather order society   ensure inequality doesnt get hand hoarding spending among certain sectors community doesnt create societal imbalances Taxation also means regulating inflation unemployment A state issues its sovereign currency therefore debt constrained private sector surplus state must deficit A government deficit that spending taxes rather issuing crediting money collected taxation adds net financial assets private sector A government surplus means government removing money private sector private accounts issued spending is crediting private accountsFor detail go here httpenwikipediaorgwikiChartalism Alert moderator 29 Nov 2011
