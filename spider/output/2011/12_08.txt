others inconvenienced waste time The TIO awesome however   prime example good governance face unsustainable self regulated industryMy big picture view regulation must occur complaints must cost service providers In first instance must per minute penalty calls made people provider Something like dollar per minute next bill Of course need policed carefully prevent abuse 10 years customers abusing system would actually fair Then unresolved consumer calls separate complaints handling organisation charges providers per interaction And complaint handling done Australians paid Australian dollars In ways known systematic issues providers quickly dry up equilibrium shifted towards financially less damaging fix systems resolve remaining complaints speedilyFinally occurring partly
