Strange though may seem lot journalists get business reason lot politicians do want change world If people told truth reckon world different place Thats undoubtedly goal drives Julian Assange WikiLeaks It goal drove Chris Masters team spent weeks investigating joke Fortitude Valley Four Corners program became known The Moonlight State It drove Bob Woodward Carl Bernstein spent night night month month chasing Watergate rabbits Watergate holes Seymour Hersh pursued truth happened My Lai In cases journalism change world least bit least while And past weeks Four Corners changed world pastoralists northern Australia better worse But rarely happens At least often bigger impact comes media efforts arent strictly speaking journalism When I first year uni Ken Loachs devastating television drama Cathy Come Home electrified Britain It brought home reality homelessness under privilege way many worthy current affairs programs failed do In early 1980s ABC drama trilogy Scales Justice exposed reality police corruption years The Moonlight State But truth is journalism drama genuinely changes attitudes rare I realised years business job describe world wanting change would distort process Nevertheless I produced several programs I naively thought would change world little bit But I also came understand part people bring prejudices read watch If see agrees think already know accept theyre told true If not not And its journalist them wrong misinformed gullible biased Peoples minds hard indeed change Whats remarkable SBSs recent reality series Go Back To Where You Came From seem changed peoples minds   went journey documented Like best ideas simple   though certainly simple pull off It cant easy persuade Malaysian immigration police conduct raid Australian witnesses UNHCR allow group Australian civilians pretend refugees even hours US Army escort Australian civilians Baghdad And programs directed shot edited high degree professional skill But made series idea finding people brought strong prejudices issue   prejudices share substantial majority Australians   well courage allow program take did It took courage too voice thought The likes Raquel Moore Darren Hassan given hell Twitter But views shared millions   people would never watched straightforward documentary SBS took us programs went For reality become real needs seen eyes people think do Of course part programs preaching converted   is section population already believes asylum seekers genuinely fleeing persecution danger But least hundreds comments SBSs website clearly people shared views majority participants Some minds changed too The Sydney Morning Heralds Paul Sheehan unmoved   objections means unreasonable This debate empathy It numbers It race It principle control borders The biggest beneficiaries strict border control would legitimate asylum seekers That reasonable position   as matter position Howard government But Sheehan wrong seems me writes programs repackaged recrafted the falsity centre debate proposition if believe stopping small number asylum seekers arrive boat lacking empathy lacking compassion probably anti Muslim Yes certainly false logical proposition There perfectly good reasons Darren Hassan articulated program people empathise plight refugees still argue everything power stop boats However anyone seen outpouring popular opinion around topic knows   executive producer The 730 Report Tampa affair I read hundreds emails letters phone messages topic week   its undeniable great many feel passionately boat people believe economic refugees opportunists search dole cheats liars sort people would throw kids sea   possibly terrorists boot That hasnt changed 10 years since Tampa Listen talkback radio day week Its lack compassion demonisation asylum seekers refugees Go Back Where You Came From seeking change What saw clearly demonstrated ordinary Australians like Raye Raquel   like ordinary people everywhere I dont think theres anything special Australians respect   kind hearted empathetic face grief suffering Getting support tough measures course would harder Australians felt boat people genuine desperate refugees Yet tough measures might still right political response problem nobody pretend straightforward But Go Back To Where You Came From seems me series political choices It simply putting Australian viewers briefly shoes many millions around world desperately hope somewhere safe live At one point program three Australians said goodbye refugee family theyd met Kenyan refugee camp Raye found crying Were leaving cant said They stay here Anyone whos foreign correspondent tougher parts world knows feeling guilt walk airport leave hell behind people endure We decide comes country circumstances come perfectly defensible principle one SBS programs attempt challenge But surely whatever political choices make cant bad thing help Australians realise come shores desperation dont deserve hatred fear
