wasnt wearing helmet would bare skull hitting bitumen ive never gone bike without helmet since encourage anyone same even travelling 40kmh still going dull impact better nothingI agree dutch argument point involvement infrastructure nothing helmets I educated child helmet goes bike without question adult dont question it dont see anti helmets law people jumping helping situation Ive never met

You expect roads 60kmh reduced 30 theyve done Germany Yes footpaths issue pedestrians bicycle paths The point infrastructure plays important part bike safety think helmet fix situation providing

mandated higher Have seen tests helmet hitting ground 40kmh Its hardly dull impact The G force sticker would attest that Once again seatbelt argument apply talking differences G forces You may never
