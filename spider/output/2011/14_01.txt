executed statistics are words statistician W A Wallis a body methods making wise decisions face uncertainty Alas ease statistics abused deception manipulation challenges public remain alert and indeed alarmedWhen George W Bush announced 2003 policy 92 million Americans receive average tax cut 1083 numbers not strictly speaking incorrect However camouflaged fact 45 million people would receive less 100 tax relief whereas top 1 income earners gifted whopping 30127Lies Damn Lies Statistics Take pick among first two dont blame science statistics President Bush cherry picked number namely mean made intended point obscuring full implications tax policy  exact opposite proper statistical practiceOh joys cherry picking Your Volvo happens lose fan belt Swedish cars poor quality You dont like Collingwood supporters find one fan served time shop lifting  club hardened criminalsAnd global warming hoax its snowing EnglandReallyOf course not Global warming inescapably real despite snow England

pictures worse useless used lieu real data The nether regions internet awash photo US submarine surfacing North Pole 1959 taken disprove global warming  knows definitely FINAL NAIL IN THE COFFIN all IN CAPS climate change sure The involuntary humour approximately 132nd final nail highlighted fact submarine surfaced 17 March sunrise North Pole While darkness rather curtails photographic

prowess alliterative headline piece made reference data instead boasted picture bronzed Aussie swimmer whose untroubled excursions Bondi beach last decades somehow put another by 154th final nail coffin climate changeThe real data incidentally show sea levels risen 4 5 cm globally last 15 yearsSilly pictures aside indubitable reality current snow ice miserable cold Europe parts North America Does disprove global warming 185th timeNoSingle events carry little information  one shoplifter tells nothing Collingwood fans one broken fanbelt undo decades quality manufacturingSo heat wave Russia last year prove climate warmingNoSingle events carry little information  single heatwave tells us little climate single blizzard Actually forensic statistical techniques exist permit robust interpretation single extreme events especially virtually unprecedented heat Victorias Black Saturday carrying us far afieldNotably extreme observations legitimately revealing considered anecdotes data That is instead cherry picking one observation proper statistical treatment requires extremes considered togetherWhen done picture unequivocal The last 5 decades seen inexorable decrease number record cold days equally steady increase number record hot days  Australia two record hot days every one record cold day If climate werent changing thered number eachYes still record cold days Australia well England India Mongolia  data considered heat records far outpace cold records Indeed 2010 nearly 20 countries broke all time heat records whereas one broke all time cold record as November subject confirmation World Meteorological OrganizationThe real data show 20 heat records 1 cold recordThat data isolated anecdote silly pictureYes snowing Britain cold Germany wherever else cherry picking anecdotes lieu real data obscures actually happening planet considerable risk children grand childrenCherry picking data support ones hypothesis proper statistics Enron proper accounting It ignorant best criminally fraudulent worstThe pernicious nature cherry picking sometimes reveals itself innocently otherwise even way question phrased The question Has significant warming since 1998 meaningful question  its cherry picked question seeks cherry picked answer must therefore remain meaninglessWhyBecause questioner chose year 1998 Or 1995 whatever year happens make desired point And whenever someone chooses anything statistics date question extreme cold England newspaper headline engaging cherry pickingThey playing Enron data Pravda mindOf course significant warming every decade since 1970s But doesnt mean years arent cooler others one always find particularly hot year such 1998 sticks far trend line subsequent years appear cooler trend catches up These years present short dream come true deny climate change agendas emotional needsIn fact one chooses brief enough period never significant warming way never gained measurable height one day next childhood Miraculously lack significant growth never prevented baby growing adultStatistics subtle confusing doubt it Thats takes decade study become true statistical expertSo alert alarmed understandably confused member public light conflicting messages statistical nonsense media Fortunately easy answer one I report peer reviewed paper appear Psychological Science All avoid confusion climate change look picture graphA graph data entire globe across available yearsIn study I showed people graph climate data asked predict future trend  one condition climate data labelled condition presented fictitious share prices Regardless condition regardless peoples attitudes towards climate science results study crystal clear Everyone  including individuals deny climate science  recognized trend is everyone knew heading peoples responses averaged across 100 observations case shown red triangles figures below So best defence cherry picking Enrons internet picture boasting Pravdas media look data yourselfAll data entire globe available yearsLike 200 participants study recognize trend without equivocationSo Mark Twain right allNoStatistics done properly provide robust revealing tool understand
