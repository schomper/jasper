believe Mr Wilders one bravest men Europe He stepped plate two prominent Dutchmen   Pym Fortuyn Theo Van Gogh   murdered temerity commit seems be days ultimate blasphemy unforgivable sin   criticising IslamI find incredible even put trial merely telling uncomfortable truths I relieved acquittedAs comparing Quran which I read btw Mein Kampf comparison valid sorts grounds original Mr Wilders No less person Churchill saw resemblance applying different direction said Mein Kampf the new Koran faith war Carl Jung too record comparing Nazism Islam comparison Karen Blixen Out Africa fame also made time
