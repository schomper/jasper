<DOC_NAME>War on WikiLeaks reveals need for law reform</DOC_NAME>
<TEXT>
The global war WikiLeaks demonisation Julian Assange troubling governments playing fast loose accusations criminal wrongdoingIn doing governments failed make sense gaps law need law reform adequately protect sensitive informationAs I written elsewhere hard see Julian Assange WikiLeaks broken Australian law It even doubtful whether United States laws broken although best may action breach copyright US government documentsWhile crime US government employees unlawfully disclose confidential information would case WikiLeaks induced solicited another person leak material That might distinguish conduct WikiLeaks media from New York Times BBC simply republished documentsSo far however US provided evidence conduct Even then might necessary consider whether legitimate media reporting public interest Different countries take different legal approaches issueIt also doubtful whether US crime espionage committed since as Australia requires intent injure country advantage foreign governmentEven elements espionage existed Australian Governments pledge cooperate US law enforcement would face high legal hurdles There old common law rule bars extradition political offenders In modern form Article VII bilateral extradition treaty Australia United States requires extradition shall granted offence political characterEspionage classic example political offence The exception originated 19th century European democracies world democratic The purpose rule prevent one country such Australia interfering domestic politics another state such United States taking side foreign government fundamentally political mattersIn words Australian law cooperate repression espionage foreign government whether United States  North Korea What interest Australia utilising legal system safeguard secrets foreign governments Espionage wrong kind legal lens focus WikiLeaksA bill currently US Congress seeks criminalise publication identity US intelligence asset For part fair enough Australia may wish informants  foreign countries WikiLeaks asserts would endanger life revealing covert identities  unlike Bush administration Valerie Plame caseThat focus espionage war WikiLeaks obscured nuanced consideration different kinds government information legally protected Over time WikiLeaks disclosed range different sources military intelligence material recent publication diplomatic cablesThe publication diplomatic cables rather dealt developing international law diplomatic inviolability Diplomatic correspondence special legal status Article 27 Vienna Convention Diplomatic Relations 1961 provides official correspondence diplomatic mission shall inviolable Article 24 adds archives documents mission shall inviolable time wherever may beWhile treaty adopted advent internet email understood cover kind diplomatic correspondence including electronic transmissions Australia party treaty Parliament given much the force law AustraliaThat treaty foremost directed towards ensuring host governments interfere diplomatic documents embassies host territory But obligation also requires governments prevent interference private actors whether burglars breaking embassies media hackers intercepting communications baggage handlers opening diplomatic bag reading correspondence airportWhile treaty specify kinds domestic laws necessary implement obligation would appropriate instance national laws make crime person violate protection diplomatic documentsThe treaty also specify meant inviolability argument made covers theft information also subsequent publication others In principle publication relevantly violates confidentiality attaches diplomatic documents In Tehran Hostages case 1979 International Court Justice observed Irans media publication US embassy documents violated international law Domestic law could follow approach So far goodHow apply WikiLeaks Some key problems arise highlight need international community consider law reform The rule requires host state protect inviolability diplomatic documents connected embassy hosted territory But require one country prevent publication diplomatic documents unlawfully obtained embassy government another countryAt best arguable treaty would allow Australia prohibit publication US diplomatic cables US Embassy Canberra even though unlawfully leaked within Australia It arguable allowing publication via internet Australia sites located abroad relevantly violates diplomatic documents hosted embassy Such interpretation would equally apply publication mainstream media Australia could legislate effectFor some gagging media way may seem unpalatable controversial But international rule guaranteeing inviolability diplomatic material enables proper functioning international relations would otherwise impaired inability frankly communicate advise delicate political problems without fear exposure embarrassment Unlike national laws espionage diplomatic law politically neutral  diplomatic documents countries friend foe inviolableAt time view rule narrow broad It narrow rationale rule holds true every country required protect diplomatic documents embassies hosted territory connected embassies anywhere worldThus diplomatic cables unlawfully intercepted Bulgarian embassy South Africa violated media republication Australia on UN diplomatic correspondence worldwide also needs protecting including spying eyes US Secretary State Hilary Clinton The rule needs universalising modernisingOn hand rule broad currently absolute admits exceptions There strong argument limited principled exceptions inviolability Where disclosure confidential diplomatic material would expose serious illegality disclosure public interest prohibitedUltimately legal responses reactive hardly solution The real issue conduct WikiLeaks dramatic failure US government protect information How relatively low level analyst manage electronically copy remove pass
