Last week end Media 140 conference I blogging day ended panellist Jason Wilson asking Who Grogs Gamut In response handful people stood announced Im Grogs Gamut No Im Grogs Gamut It response organised advance friends including Wilson bit joke throughout day name Grogs Gamut mentioned times   point Osman Faruqi tweeting drink every time mentioned pretty well ear Well longer need ask question Today James Massola The Australian taken upon me Apparently knowing I Greg Jericho in public interest head ABC Mark Scott mentioned speech blog post attacking journalists coverage campaign and specifically lack policy mentioned ABC executive meeting The first example blogs Twitter traffic Halfway campaign ABC executive met Monday morning discussed weekend blog Canberra public servant writing tag Grogs Gamut It lacerating critique journalists following candidates obsession transient matters political scandal day He met chorus praise support triggering barrage criticism campaign coverage So head ABC took notice something I wrote anonymously journalism I need named I guess lesson want blog anonymously dont effectively Whatever think Massolas decision and certainly decision preference I say known I since last November Why decided reveal name now given Scotts speech delivered September 2 say No doubt reasons thinks valid The justification story actually came media editor yes bizarre I someone national daily needs justify outing If public servant blogging tweeting sometimes airing partisan political line deserve anonymity No Journalists editors grant anonymity sources whistleblowers Grogs Gamut know now Greg Jericho active participant public debate via Twitter blog The ABCs managing director Mark Scott cited Grogs Gamut criticism medias election coverage ABC news meeting result we adjusted strategy Fair enough But influencing public debate particularly public servant publics right know are It medias duty report it Take however want to Now Massolas article Firstly headline Controversial political blogger unmasked federal public servant Well unmasking public servant actually happened ago   fact Massola wrote August 7 Hobby writers keep pros toes A funny thing happened political blogosphere last week The mainstream media got serious self analysis critical post Canberra public servant blogs name Grogs Gamut But oh well didnt write headline Ill let pass keeper He writes Mr Jericho subject intrigue Media 140 conference Canberra last Thursday embedded anonymous blogger wore name tag gave first name last He knows sat coincidence table conference late afternoon I noticed him knew name I sent private message Twitter letting know I table He talk day fact left session ended pity chatted fair bit Twitter I interested meet him Stupidly I know given known name 10 months I concerned would me As others conference I didnt journalists   people asked post event drinks by time journalists left I Grogs Gamut I said I was Strangely none gave stuff real name was Heres fun bit Massolas article At height insulation scandal engulfed Peter Garrett defended former minister writing Garrett demoted good reason  Garrett demoted despite no one media opposition actually able explain exactly level intelligence wrong deemed bungled Yep I certainly believed that still do How I come view By reading newspapers also reading publicly released reports insulation scheme coming opinion Its opinion differs The Australians I never access anything areas handled insulation program I knew much or little anyone reads media He also quotes In comparison Mr Jericho wrote opposition climate spokesman Greg Hunt could write PhD thesis environmental political cowardice Opposition Leader Tony Abbott the master spin and Rooty Hill leaders forum because wasnt debate Abbott able get away inordinate amount bullshit Yep two opinions I disappointed Hunt I big fan prior dumping support carbon price   I would liked see Turnbull cross floor I actually think long term career would better served so And yes I thought Rooty Hill format joke going last as Julia Gillard Brisbane need worry getting picked anything The format loaded advantage person going second But heres thing Libs got line I would turned kept job I always done including I Howard   apolitically Massola cites APS Values the APS apolitical performing functions impartial professional manner Damn straight is And I   I performing functions Heres Public Service Commission says political views Participating political activities It quite acceptable APS employees participate political activities part normal community affairs APS employees may become members hold office political party APS employees whether members political parties expected separate personal views policy issues performance official duties This important part professionalism impartiality APS employee Where APS employee involved publicly promoting party views certain issues duties directly concerned advising directing implementation administration government policy issues potential conflicts interest  Well Id say tweeting blogging Tony Abbott community forum Rooty Hill fairly well smack middle normal community affairs  I member political party  I separate personal views  Once I never written policy program I directly concerned advising directing implementation thereof or even indirectly matter Massola little analogy The revelation Mr Jerichos identity latest string anonymous authors unmasked Belle De Jour author Diary London Call Girl   revealed Brooke Magnanti   writer Helen Demidenko author The Hand Signed Paper subsequently revealed Helen Darville now Dale The Australians Christian Kerr outed Hillary Bray contributor Crikey Nice Im compared prostitute Heres thing   Belle De Jour writing experience inside knowledge Kerr Hillary Bray I not I never offered information publicly known Helen Demidenko contrast pretending someone order work appear authentic Had I saying I political insider staffer analogy would correct It not At least Massola quote saying Asked concerned partisan political views appropriate role public service Mr Jericho said I never write anything I work either blog Twitter So I thought easiest   given I want continue saying something opinion   go pseudonym Ive worked public service Liberal government Labor government overseeing programs policy I really care I working   its purely policy program paramount Ive never difficulty working either side My supervisors never problem And Im writing home dinner I comment issues nothing work Look I know theres fair bit heat directed Massola Twitter But Im pick fight him I wish hadnt written piece has no aint getting Christmas card Throughout last 12 months I Twitter I often arguments journalists I would like think I never abusive I blocked one journalist I made snarky comment one Saturday morning retweeted one followers yet I never attacked journalist blog   fact even defended comments I know many journalists Twitter think Massola right thing Some less publicly not Debate away must My bugbear would nice provided links blog that standard courtesy online So everyone or least small care knows I am So public interest served Do words carry less weight yesterday I dont think so I started blog back 2008 I chose name Grog nickname back days uni early 90s not due drinking ability due illegible handwriting made Greg look like Grog note I wrote friend I using Grog posting Poll Bludger I actually quoted Samantha Maiden The Oz 2007 response bad Newspoll quoted comments made Poll Bludger nervous lefties   comment actually tell everyone calm worry   unfortunately its online anymore When I decided start blog I thought sensible keep online name I would writing politics much I Poll Bludger   generally online people keep name across different blogs Also public servant I didnt want keep making clear views own I hobby etc etc That said I never viewed Grog free pass write anything I wanted to As said I never write area policy at moment film except peripheral sense   ie movies I like odd promotion upcoming Australian films I think looks interesting I never written anything I gleaned work All information I use comes media press releases public reports This pretty clear anyone regularly reads blog   never find breaking inside news   find opinion analysis I also never used advertising   despite quite friends work online saying Im mad to My view even I make pocket money writing partisan political commentary I would wrong so I wrote piece The Drum purely media coverage made political comment wish deeper policy sides Ironically blog post got coverage included praising Liberal Party disability policy though I still dont know daughter would qualified I chose Grogs Gamut title blog title pieces stream consciousness guff I wrote boarding college paper time uni And blog continues Ill keep using title name So now Well well see Ill keep posted I hope I keep blogging even sport films books media geez theres ample material Maybe media cant cope blog gets 1000 readers day Personally I think can As The Australians Matthew Franklin attest journalist ever thinks I wronged them I acknowledge oversight make correction And despite obvious dislike much written The Australian best wrap I ever received featured website George Megolagenis last blog going leave responded comment reader wishing well suggesting

If learn one useful thing article   would well average posts   learn this thing high profile anonymous blogger Thats lesson GrogsGamut blogger tweeter sometime Drum contributor learned The Australians James Massola outed late last night arts bureaucrat Greg Jericho Which name secret agent cool I might well use pseudonym someday For havent visited pit seething fury webs premier microblogging service become today lets say Twittersphere isnt happy Massola received deluge abuse detractors replaced pictures Grogs avatar   might explain many people feed confusingly transformed Ralph Fiennes The question whether bloggers tweeters able remain anonymous somewhat moot internet age takes five seconds sign up But maintaining anonymity work becomes popular far difficult   ask another Drum writer Marieke Hardy extraordinary honour outed Andrew Bolt Anonymity invites guessing game always clues blog personal details generally dull And get caught out nearly every time This wont greatest day Greg Jerichos life Hell doubt hauled awkward meeting bosses make hard decisions whether continue online activities   hes even allowed to Ill leave precise interpretation Public Service rules other thorough bloggers like Jericho himself It wont even comfort think hes dual identity dilemma routinely faced Superman His exposure newsworthy   limited extent   post wrote criticising travelling press pack recent campaign His accusation focussing trivialities exclusion policy picked Mark Scott Managing Director ABC passed national broadcasters news team As far anonymous bloggers go made pretty darn influential   Id astonished boss ever bothered read internet drivel instance But gives Massolas expos something stench sour grapes Jerichos article critical Oz and particular News Ltd stablemate Sky News   point journalist noted report It also regrettable article posted without link Jerichos post enable readers judge themselves Grog also notes Massola known real identity since November makes decision publish matter interest Whether anticipation response Twitter outrage Oz posted editorial shortly Massolas story broke justifying story basis Jericho influencing public debate Scotts actions But Jericho couldnt known whod read article In fact hitherto largely unknown blogger would verging megalomaniacal think argument would prove influential The Australian asserted publics right know worthy principle practice often reflects invokers agenda But someone whose occasional thoughts read interest small number Canberra insiders hardly prime candidate public tarring feathering It feels rather like Oz opted play anonymous man instead ball Nevertheless heres I become slightly uncomfortable Ive accused The Australian agenda beyond explicit text article   greater purpose affected theyve chosen write theyve chosen leave out This view dramatic effect I choose read article But comes Grogs blog weve access information anonymity makes far harder us assess say Now Im saying every anonymous scribe immediately unmasked James Massola   one thing would make column dreadfully dull But means read anonymous writers work considerably skepticism would identified themselves I mean sure   Grog said public servant   hasnt claimed public servant then Even I did try impress girl bar Canberra And heres second useful piece information contained article didnt work But I disagree occasion publics right know justifies disruption caused Jerichos life Mark Scotts directions news team ultimately call ABC editor in chief its unreasonable hold authors articles whose critiques may choose adopt responsible them Theres also argument Jericho somewhat responsible outing himself gives us Useful Lesson 3 story If youre worried sensitive identity behind Twitter account exposed its probably best attend conference full high profile tweeters hiding behind fig leaf nametag without surname And yet Jericho voluntarily entered room full journalists Which its bit peculiar people furious Massola whos paid report interesting tidbits Canberra   surely struggle best times It would difficult resist story sat conference table And moral obligation respect Grogs chosen limits hidden identity is circumstances question politeness rather duty So leave us First weve learnt guy nations film bureaucracy pretty darn smart analyst except comes decisions attending conferences I think Jericho keep job given vital task preventing triviality Australian film industry With Grog deck therell Danny Deckchairs Secondly weve learned nations tweeters dont like James Massola much moment And like Jericho rather lot Then again dont know personally Thirdly its difficult preserve anonymity work enters public sphere its probably best try If even mighty Top Gear cant keep Stigs identity wraps hope anyone else got And finally weve learned The Australians difficulty identifying whether issue trivial receive column space hasnt entirely corrected Dominic Knight real Grogs Gamut Chaser writer recently
