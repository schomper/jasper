<TEXT>
The race fill Canberras skyline apartments left residents facing potentially deadly problems There push towards greater urban density ACT government planners environmental groups But evidence Canberras demand new units outstripped industrys capacity deliver Imagine sitting terrace breakfast prestige unit 50 kilogram glass panel crash cereal million dollar lake view interrupted unwanted water feature pouring lounge room ceiling Those extreme examples sort unit construction issues Owners Corporation Network OCN worried The group represents concerned ACT unit owners say serious problems quality unit construction Canberra OCN president Gary Petherbridge says problems widespread including serious safety issues one unit complex There 4000 glass balcony panels spread across complex significant number shattered pieces   sometimes large lumps   fallen freely ground said Thats quite hazard four stories up quite lot weight them Theyre dangerous Mr Petherbridge says unit owners becoming increasingly frustrated There probably order 60000 100000 Canberra residents got interest sorts places whether live investors said There lot people involved deserve better run getting Government There needs bit balance people like ACT Planning accept building quality important building fast The problems according OCN basic building errors overlooked certification process left owners fix Judith Erskine Murray Upton bought unit five years ago downsizing family home Mr Upton says made move expectation would make life less complicated What didnt expect problems began bought new unit said For first least year probably longer perpetually bothered tradesmen come attempt fix many defects unit contained said Defects like ensuite waterproofing leaking roof tiles layed wrong way painting problems hot water system work The hot water system certified meeting right code The fact didnt supply hot water didnt seem matter Mr Upton said Were probably bit unlucky know experience friends people problem common throughout Canberra Mrs Erskine says frustrating five year process get someone take responsibility unit problems many approaches disregarded Were whingers Weve totally negative results developer original builder   company folded shortly building complete said Disappearing developers common problem according Owners Corporation Network The developers often disappear within several months project fully sold stage theyre longer easy track make responsible things go wrong Gary Petherbridge said In rare concession government agency ACT Planning Land Authority ACTPLA agrees system problems Chief executive Neil Savery says 10 areas reviewed approval construction certification process The bottom line clearly building sites dont meet standards home owners expect said I say quite genuinely expect building industry going lift game Based anecdotal evidence well complaints weve received following up evidence quality building work certain circumstances isnt standard expect If industry doesnt something Government will That tough talk organisation pressure wake failed planning decisions like recent Kingston Quayside fiasco ACTPLA given green light unit development decision overturned Civil Administrative Tribunal described original approval mystery The current ACTPLA rhetoric strong building quality issues action eventually comes determine spin substance Mr Savery says important issue What precise nature regulation whether incentives disincentives yet fully worked weve started discussion said The building industry absolutely notice definitely said The ACT Master Builders Association reacted pressure reviewing training building supervision programs Deputy chief executive Jerry Howard says industry moved away good traditional building practices What were getting traditionally green fields builders concentrated stand alone houses progressing across multi unit development said Probably needs specific skills addressed youre bringing people across might skills actually deal complex types projects I dont think builders taking short cuts I think theyve got time pressures sometimes default time pressures work may done possibly standard be So building industry says basic mistakes made problems owners like Alexander Mattea say also missed building certifiers The certification process last 10 years really become self certification rubber stamp said I bought essentially brand new building five years ago I reasonable expectation couldnt go wrong brand new building certainly expensive building Very soon I realised I shouldnt believed everything I told Certification process provide purchasers assurance getting paid for Mr Mattea describes system outrageous disappointment He says one many Canberra unit owners resorted costly legal action construction issues The solution really going courts said Thats block done its process thats going nearly three years Its monumental undertaking its difficult believe persistent well managed body corporates could do Im talking building dozens buildings limited time Ive explore subject I know similar worse problems ACTPLA building industry defended certification process amidst claims OCN fundamental conflict interest certifiers paid builders developers I cant say whether claim correct its job investigate personal arrangements builder developer certifier Neil Savery said What systems place audit quality work find someone underperformed done wrong thing ability take action I well understand perception issue discussed private certification introduced Jerry Howard said But I think certification system pretty robust here The unit owners want know   regulatory framework robust   standards allowed slip Neil Savery says problems systemic Its much its slipped I think whole works effectively There always going areas sort system weaknesses said As unit owners still battle builders developers courts get problems fixed bureaucrats building industry promising change Training
