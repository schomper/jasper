We look lessons failed breast implants investigate complementary therapies people cancer Source Tonic  Duration 27min 28sec Transcript Norman Hello welcome Tonic Norman Swan This week were going look lessons failed breast implants devices might save lives future Tarnya Walker Not able work able support family debilitating Especially sort sense dont look sick like people look I dont look sick Chris Baggoley A couple programs commercial television really hammered line toxic time bombs There quite number women Im told aware problem PIP breast implants really panicked Tarnya Walker You sort doubt feel like I making know Is real Is Im feeling real All I say mentally Im strong person I really struggled Norman And complementary therapies like yoga acupuncture people cancer Lorenzo Cohen What really quite amazing early three weeks study start see fewer symptoms recorded acupuncture patients Norman Now often get emails asking stories complementary medicine And one reason dont lot stories complementary therapies Tonic theres huge amount scientific research them But changing fact recently went one worlds leading cancer centres MD Anderson Cancer Centre Houston Texas theyve researching acupuncture treat serious side effects cancer therapy Lorenzo Cohen Head neck cancer patients undergo radiotherapy chemoradiotherapy primary treatment end getting horrible side effect called Xerostomia essentially chronic dry mouth And although may sound relatively benign dry mouth quite problematic cancer patients They end difficulty swallowing difficulty eating difficulty speaking disrupts sleep importantly decreased saliva flow unhealthy oral cavity Norman So its really miserable symptom Lorenzo Cohen Yeah And theres research showing acupuncture somebodys finished radiation chronic Xerostomia help improve symptoms help improve saliva flow But study colleagues Shanghai China interested incorporating acupuncture radiation treatment plan assessed self report symptom dry mouth every week throughout radiation one month later six months later also collected objective measures could call saliva flow So standardised fashion measuring much saliva could collect mouth five minute period Norman And results Lorenzo Cohen What really quite amazing early three weeks study start see separation groups terms fewer symptoms reported acupuncture patients well significantly higher saliva flow remained true even month six months end radiation Woman You might feel little bit shouldnt much Norman The people control group didnt acupuncture all people said need whats called sham acupuncture might nothing whatsoever Chinese meridians traditional acupuncture points its putting needle What think that Lorenzo Cohen Well case I think points really important Norman The acupuncture points Lorenzo Cohen The acupuncture points ones use Woman Ok tell feel something might subtle pulling little ache Lorenzo Cohen But weve recently published small follow study 20 patients exact design 10 patients received called sham acupuncture received real needles fake points instead inside ear received needles helix ear differences actually profound We didnt six month follow differences emerged 3 weeks treatment one month time point significantly different self reports Xerostomia symptoms Norman It isnt acupuncture theyve studying MD Anderson theyve looking yoga too But yoga benefits people going cancer treatment aspect yoga it Is breathing exercises meditation stress relief relaxation exercise what tease apart Lorenzo Cohen This followed much larger study 150 women 50 participating yoga program 3 days week throughout 6 weeks radiation 50 assigned usual care control group importantly active control group women engaged stretching exercises amount time frequency yoga group Norman And involved yoga exercises Lorenzo Cohen This yoga specifically designed breast cancer patients undergoing radiation started around 20 minutes gentle joint loosening breathing exercises incorporate gentle movements breath Then taught seven simple postures side bends back bends forward bends learned pranayama breathing exercise called alternate nostril breathing finished session gentle meditation deep relaxation technique And found end radiation treatment actually stretching yoga group reported reduction fatigue levels slight increase usual care control group differences stretch yoga However one month three months six months later yoga group reported much higher levels physical functioning overall general health ability find meaning illness experience Norman What mean that Lorenzo Cohen Well self report measure essentially asks aspects purpose life able grow experience life threatening illness called breast cancer And see literature its individuals somehow see benefit could possibly come diagnosed breast cancer ones better Norman Do better Lorenzo Cohen Just overall terms quality life suggestion increased survival So cancer often give people licence make changes perhaps little leery made previously Norman Meditation quite controversial cancer people say meditate lot really benefit it evidence changes immune system question direction good ill think that Lorenzo Cohen Thats hard know By stretching group were controlling number things One  social support would receive group setting extra attention youre getting somebody medical staff extra attention coming hospital course were controlling movements chose stretches typically recommended breast cancer patients also mirrored asana portion yoga postures really controversial meditation changes brain better So recent study Harvard group showing theres increase hippocampal volume were talking blood flow electrical activity brain were talking change anatomy size different parts brain due meditation based exercises The finding really important study found stress hormone differences specifically measure cortisol stress hormone circadian nature it cortisol levels generally high morning slowly drop throughout course day lowest night theres research showing steeper slope throughout course day better prediction mortality specifically stage 4 breast cancer patients found baseline everyone nice steep slope none groups different other end radiation groups somewhat blunting end day levels never dropped far down yoga group significantly steeper curve lower levels evening compared groups And I dont think exercise component going result kind outcome Would mediation result kind outcome We dont know thats fodder future studies Casey Beros Qi Gong Tai Chi ancient Chinese wellness practices involving range slow meditative dance like movements emphasising regulation breath calming mind Theyre based belief life essence chi running invisible channels body theory chi disrupted illness occurs Believers say practices effective healing tools chronic conditions like arthritis also relieving stress theres evidence back up Researchers looked practices effectiveness various illnesses disorders evidence improvement bone health cardiorespiratory fitness physical function balance quality life fall prevention psychological state Qi Gong Tai Chi gentle meditative practices suitable people ages fitness abilities They seem health benefits well worth giving go terms mind body wellbeing relaxation Tarnya Walker Not able work able support family debilitating Especially sort sense dont look sick like people look I dont look sick You sort doubt feel like I making know Is real Is Im feeling real know reason All I say mentally Im strong person I really struggled Karen Carey Over last decade tens thousands women around world implanted PIP breast implants find years later manufacturer used industrial silicone instead medical grade silicone The first signs problem appeared 2005 took Australian international regulators 5 years issue recall late many women already implanted A lot learned PIP experience need use knowledge drive changes way regulate monitor medical devices make safer everybody Tarnya Walker The reason I operation 2 children I skin G cup filling A Karen Carey Australia lead world investigating could happen clinical implications women implants role government take funding surgery that women started cosmetic procedure ended potentially serious health risk Chris Baggoley Well theres 2 phases course devices havent implanted process started 2010 TGA worked sponsor brought PIP implants country worked surgeons recall devices longer used The bigger issue though course people implants cant recall implants people already inside them issue alerting people implants problem go see doctor GP surgeon So issue communicating people implants major issue Karen Carey What quickly became apparent TGA system communicate surgeons implanting PIP device patients receiving them one collecting basic information single database And meant TGA instead communicating directly surgeons patients rely media get safety messages out Chris Baggoley The best communication I felt still feel direct communication Weve learnt process may range media this lot media overseas media advised health information lines yet couple programs commercial television really hammered line toxic time bombs There quite number women Im told aware problem PIP breast implants course I think people look information get concerning information concerns them really panicked Tarnya Walker The biggest thing children knowing youre going there thats hard Karen Carey Women waited terrible anxiety TGAs test results available even fully trust reassurances TGA industrial silicone cause range symptoms many women experiencing risk re operation women ruptures needed carefully considered Chris Baggoley I think come learn advice thats seen come government greeted suspicion its sad thats way is Tarnya Walker You know Im medical person I cant say going cause cancer I certainly cant say its going to So wonder know silicone go Theyre trying tell stay within breast well Im sorry I dont believe that I dont think say true were four five years track start know answers So I wonder health implications Ive got whether related breast implants Karen Carey We could answer questions data registries record gets device perform time It would also solve problem able communicate directly patients something goes wrong Chris Baggoley So continued reflection get people quickly sit doctor discuss entire situation Karen Carey What happened next TGA investigate actual risks were And demonstrated serious problems The PIP implants manufactured France several months French authorities reluctant hand information testing conducted lead issuing world wide recall So TGA testing   takes time   waiting women implants left imagining worst Tarnya Walker The longer wait bigger health complications anxiety builds knowing like I two ruptures implants I suspect Ive mine couple years given sick Ive been every day I wonder effect me How much sicker I going time I get operation Does mean I get operation Im still going long term health implications Karen Carey It took several months TGA collect batches PIP implants pulled shelves prior implant test   even longer collect ones implanted explanted women ruptures This process would much faster French regulator assisted information   raises issues around safety trade offs come global harmonisation is letting single country thats party harmonisation safety effectiveness evaluations countries put devices patients Chris Baggoley Where mutual recognition like regulatory processes Australia rely integrity regulation pre marketing approval assessment international regulators Karen Carey It appears rather conducting manufacturing audits French regulator pays independent companies conduct fee paid manufacturer  means patients Australia around world unwittingly relying profit making businesses France assess safety quality without scrutiny regulator Chris Baggoley As society dont like red tape dont like regulation much something goes wrong want know where red tape regulation protect us So Australia go process mutual recognition system assessing every device would slow import use valuable devices need human health Karen Carey Its also issue cost The US regulator FDA employs around 17000 people The TGA Australias regulator employs around 700 people manage around number therapeutic goods thats drugs devices We hate waste money big bureaucracies health really want money spent coalface providing care patients case getting wrong Chris Baggoley So its balancing act And I think thats post market assessment scrutiny I think becomes particularly important The issue important raise relation medical devices unlike drugs cant clinical trials occur drugs different phases clinical trials double blind trials use placebo drugs medical device put cant pretend wasnt couldnt ethically put device didnt work So its complex area I think thats issue follow post marketing surveillance becomes important Karen Carey At moment countries device approved clinical trial evidence weve heard less rigorous record gets device whether its safe effective implanted In modern society much information us electronically stored linked seems shocking crucial information health assist safety efficacy cost effectiveness evaluation long term isnt collected Chris Baggoley The part people made aware theres problem There quite number people didnt know implant had keeping records youve got something inside you certainly keep records there Karen Carey And whilst waiting electronic health records provide post market surveillance developed consumers help ensuring issues medical device reported directly TGA well information website We also links reliable information women PIP implants help make decision whether undergo re operation And website   tonictvcomau Norman And its time Food Fix match food health Nikki Heyder This roast vegetable quinoa salad great way get extra veges diet Its also extremely
