<DOC_NAME>Community leaders call for legislation to prevent families from marrying off young girls to loggers</DOC_NAME>
<TEXT>
Community leaders in Solomon Islands are calling on provincial governments to introduce legislation to prevent families from marrying off young girls to workers at logging camps The Chairman of the Child Protection Unit in Honiara Aaron Olofia told Pacific Beat teenagers under the age of 18 in Solomon Islands need parental consent to marry He says many families have been marrying off their young daughters in return for food or money The families themselves because they do not have plenty of money at their disposal allow their daughters to be married to these loggers so these loggers could maintain them by giving money or food he said    There is an assumption that parents allow their daughters to be married When you are in a state of powerlessness what can you do Sometimes the girls themselves were forced to be married Logging is the largest industry in Solomon Islands and accounts for 60 per cent of its export earnings Despite this locals say theyve seen little benefit and instead claim their lives are now much worse Financial hardship has led to greater inequality and a violation of human rights such as the commercial sexual exploitation of children The sexual exploitation of young girls remains a huge problem in the Malaita province The president of the Malaita Council of Women Martha Rurai says while community leaders are making efforts to address the issue they are pleading for help from the provincial governments She says they want legislation introduced that would provide protection for these young girls We would like to give it up to the provincial government so that we have some kind of resolution to be controlled with the communities and loggers she said Ms Rurai says some communities are very strong in ensuring the young girls do not land in the hands of the loggers something which Mr Olofia has observed as well One of the logging companies that we went and talked to actually told us a policy that any logger who married a local girl would be sent home US10000 fine he said They do not encourage their loggers to get married to a local girl However other communities are not as strong in their resolve Many of the young women who are married off to loggers are underage according to the social workers who add that the loggers often return back to their home country abandoning the women and children in Solomon Islands Despite their vulnerable situation the women do not get any support or protection from the provincial government Mr Olofia says the Child Protection Unit is calling on the government to have strict policy to help protect the women from such abusive situation If you have influence you can ask the loggers to pay compensation But again the compensation is only to settle the breach that has occurred he said The compensation does not cater for the upbringing of any children but Mr Olofia says there is little some  families can do The committee is trying to advocate for a change in government policy that makes it hard that helps us to provide laws for the protection of these kinds of situations for young girls who work in these logging camps he said Topicsforestryenvironmentsolomon islandspacific     First posted           December 03 2013 203724
