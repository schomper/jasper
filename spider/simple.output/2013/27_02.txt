Energy company AGL beaming todays half year net profit results 3647 million 212 per cent Ticky speaks CEO Michael Fraser results intervening state governments creating headaches Source The Business  Duration 12min 29sec Topics industry business economics and finance oil and gas australia Transcript TICKY FULLERTON Energy company AGL beaming today   half year net profit 3647 million 212 per cent That included gain 85 million revaluing hedging even result spoke itself driven performance retail strong wholesale prices newly bedded in power station Loy Yang I spoke CEO Michael Fraser results intervening state governments creating headaches Michael Fraser welcome program MICHAEL FRASER Thanks Ticky TICKY FULLERTON Your results certainly approved market   lots questions analysts Your New South Wales electricity customer base 680000 customers I see youre aggressively going buying market share MICHAEL FRASER No were not I think weve made point today Ticky were interested profitless growth Weve seen deep discounting competitors last half Despite that weve continuing grow New South Wales electricity customer base I would expect continue second half But weve also announced today were pulling door knocking New South Wales Victoria That follows us previously pulled South Australia Queensland obviously thats going impact growth customers second half TICKY FULLERTON So were going left religious do gooders door we MICHAEL FRASER That may well case I dont think door knocking   end day customers telling us its good experience them I dont think company control happens doorstep impact brand I think its good thing customers were stopping practice I think itll good thing brand TICKY FULLERTON Your retail results impacted carbon tax I think 40 millionWhen I spoke Virgin Australias John Paul Getty yesterday said able recover carbon tax customers increased competition say youre going able that MICHAEL FRASER Look I think go back whole thing everybody recognised carbon going big impact upon electricity prices The Governments compensation package households primarily designed compensate households impact rise electricity prices In places like New South Wales price regulated extra cost taken account passed consumers TICKY FULLERTON Were market deregulated would problems passing on think MICHAEL FRASER I think deregulation weve seen Victoria absolutely helps consumers I mean Victoria fourth year row rated competitive retail energy market anywhere world Prices deregulated there There   its competition highest point country obviously thats good outcome customers So yes deregulation certainly helps competition thats experience certainly helps consumers TICKY FULLERTON Just regulation   Queensland I see youve 20 million hit EBIT regulator there QCA decision Are hopeful regulator look deregulation South Australia perhaps look move way MICHAEL FRASER Its politicians Queensland rather regulatorsThe regulators carry theyre charged State Government We saw draft determination Queensland regulator last week Theyre proposing 21 per cent increase Queensland consumers A lot catch state government imposed price freeze last year number drivers going on So I think Queenslands great example regulation prevent prices going up seen half competition Queensland drop historic lows So youre getting higher prices anyway youre getting people pulling market wanting compete Queensland market really Queenslanders left worst worlds TICKY FULLERTON Nationally Michael argument going work years come Because even competition unless get sort regulation arent electricity prices energy prices going go retail customers unless gas exporters forced reserve portion domestic market potentially lower prices MICHAEL FRASER Look I think gas market whole world certainly decisions weve seen policies announced New South Wales last week around coal seam gas thats absolutely going push price gas New South Wales right across east coast weve got big LNG projects starting Gladstone Theyre going like big vacuum cleaner sucking gas east coast youve got state governments sterilising resources would domestic market obviously put upward pressure So thats gas market I think I look electricity market   influence gas ultimately terms power generation   New South Wales Victoria South Australia I think weve seen last large price increases driven network prices thats really driven prices Queensland separate world froze prices last year theres still catch up going there TICKY FULLERTON But dont see time gas exports impacting gas electricity markets impacting domestic prices MICHAEL FRASER I think theres doubt LNG exports going factor going put upward pressure prices electricity gas No question that But question ask is deliver lower prices otherwise would be And evidence Victoria youve got competitive retail market youve got enormous choice youve got lot deep discounting going on So whilst prices might rise event certainly lower otherwise would youve got highly competitive market I think one things think   weve made point Queensland   cannot invest confidence power generation sector Queensland We others done past regulator come along said thanks much invest puts downward pressure prices   were going let competition work well suppress price What means long term people simply dont invest When people dont invest dont get additional supply dont get additional supply end higher pricesSo evidence youve got deregulate markets let competition work let customers choice TICKY FULLERTON You mentioned unwelcome developments New South Wales Government The value Camden Hunter CSG coal seam gas assets say may well written down That doesnt seem bode well future government announcement this MICHAEL FRASER Well I mean I meeting Premier yesterday afternoon took fact 329 million dollars invested far Camden Hunter obligation disclose market done today fact likely write value assets Of course quite bit ambiguity minds policy Government announced work practice detail And time understand detail actually see planning instruments cant form view level impairment be But certainly its going to think cause us write value assets based know TICKY FULLERTON When met Government yesterday get response comments fact 2 billion could wiped investment sector could threaten thousands manufacturing jobs MICHAEL FRASER I would say first constructive meeting Premier   engaged listened issues certainly clear understood potential impacts were certainly end meeting understood potential impacts New South Wales economy course AGL The key thing recognise real concern community coal seam gas quite frankly scare mongering gone there wouldnt concerned member community didnt know facts case So recognise that really discussion focused industry build confidence community industry I really talked Premier need ensure dont state cut nose spite face effectively sterilising valuable resources owned people New South Wales future development So thats were focussed   trying work way forward provide confidence community coal seam gas operations still resources available develop future confidence good TICKY FULLERTON Strategically happen write CSG assets say youve actually got pinch point Cooper Basin contracts end 2016 17 MICHAEL FRASER Thats absolutely right Both Cooper Basin contracts Bass Strait contracts come end 2016 2017We arent major supplier   people buy gas producers contracts come end kind timeframe So real pinch point coming domestic market The LNG projects start 2014 15 coinciding roll off domestic supply contracts So real pinch point gas prices east coast And one things weve said today formal disputes formal arbitration processes price gas right producers So producers looking higher prices right now Theyre waiting around start up LNG projects TICKY FULLERTON Are worried Federal Government intervention CSG MICHAEL FRASER The Federal Government clearly role play The Gloucester Project Stage One actually received Commonwealth approvals   Tony Burke granted approvals subject number conditions week clearly want expand Gloucester Project likely also get Commonwealth approval around that Certainly I think anybody industry right concerned level government involvement weve seen kind sovereign risk issues face whats happened New South Wales last fortnight TICKY FULLERTON A big contributor results today Loy Yang power station wholesale electricity prices MICHAEL FRASER Well weve seen prices wholesale market remain fairly subdued half reality think well buying Loy Yang We think bought good price really result delivered exactly said Loy Yang would deliver business its everybody see TICKY FULLERTON Looks like strong results Michael Fraser thank much joining us MICHAEL
