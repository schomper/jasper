Despite advertising hype elections usually continuation contests led them campaign seems like exception writes Peter Reith The 2013 election running So far going plan sides As today although election looks like could decided campaign I cant help think might one elections finish started Kevin Rudd came back salvage votes Labor done job I sure more Only time tell Rudd made two standard useful strategic moves First appointed better people Rudd installed Bruce Hawker office Bruce lot experience wily common sense Chris Bowen also convincing Treasurer Before economic statement I thought parallel Labors side could appointment Bill Hayden treasurer Whitlam near end Whitlam years Hayden came late save Labor made name sensible policy Unfortunately Fridays economic statement bad Bowen might take recover The third person mention Tony Burke formerly Gillard supporter minister stopping boats Although shameless spin master I would acknowledge Tony Burke bad communications One moment vehemently hates Rudd next couldnt closer new boss Machiavelli would proud him The second simple effective strategy fix policies problem Labor Rudd moved issues like union power Labor party inoculation ICAC NSW Labor carbon tax The historic parallel Keating 1993 offering electorate match Coalition numerous benefits without GST Hewson set agenda Keating replied I saying problems Rudd fix least worked pitch voters In experience despite advertising hype elections pretty much continuation usual contests leading election So chances election last months Of course always chance one side make mistake like Hewson GST cake 1993 But generally days campaigns well managed mistakes minimal Events outside control campaign managers things watch for Both sides busy preparation Kevin Rudd least given best chance His problem carries lot political baggage  Dumping leaders nothing new sides politics It destabilising people might think Gillard dumped Rudd 2010 Rudd dumped Gillard 2013 Downer gave way Howard 1995 Hayden dropped Hawke start 1983 election Keating finally terminated Hawke 1991 The dumping policy probably important more I would say Rudd least given best chance His problem carries lot political baggage He worked hard dump it But boat people economy Rudd choice best dig hole created The Governments economic statement last Friday compulsory performance Treasury present update election legislated Charter Budget Honesty If prospect news going bad choice try get way campaign starts What amazing bad numbers were massive debt rising unemployment another delay surplus effectively never never plan avoid recession seems likely day day In fact bad statement may end significant aspect entire campaign  Personally given direction economy I cant see Rudd ask public trust economy focus economic agenda fair enough economic management number one issue election Rudd certainly deliver lines He makes word chutzpah look inadequate fact even chutzpah might Kevins best chance On Coalitions side bit dumping might wise The paid paternal leave policy favourite Abbott looks inappropriate fiscal situation deteriorates The decision commit reintroducing Labors FBT change also problem later The Coalition right complain lack consultation Rudds 18b slug car industry truth damage done time election over It Labor decision left Labor wear political consequences of like Labor wear effects regressive tax slug low income smokers And decision support Gonski seems odd Coalition saying throwing money education answer poor academic performance But Coalition starts slight lead Abbott well deserved reputation disciplined campaigner It good contest PS As member Citizens No Case opposing local government referendum great hear Rudd dump referendum The idea writing local government Constitution lost twice dumped once Never government try buy result spending taxpayers money bias outcome Congratulations citizens turned tide The defeat Labors plans came hands Tony Abbott
