<DOC_NAME>Jeffrey Smart remembered: independent artist honoured at Canberra memorial service</DOC_NAME>
<TEXT>
Australian artist Jeffery Smart has been remembered at a memorial service at the National Gallery of Australia in Canberra Governor General Quentin Bryce who knew Mr Smart for 30 years recalled a man who was a great conversationalist I always called him Mr Smart she said It somehow suited his urbane self I think it is fair to say hes one of our most loved artists Mr Smart is best known for his figurative depictions of the urban landscape dotted with road signs oil drums and freeways and often featuring a single human figure Industrial objects and scenes worked their way into Mr Smarts paintings after they caught his eye while he was driving past Former director of the Art Gallery of New South Wales Edmund Capon told the memorial a story about Jeffrey Smart arriving for the opening of a retrospective of his work He said Mr Smart observed one of the paintings on loan for the show was not in as good as a condition as he wished it to be The artist wandered up to the conservation department and returned with a paintbrush and some varnish which he then proceeded to apply to the painting in full view of television cameras filming the opening National Gallery of Australia Director Ron Radford remembered Mr Smart as sarcastic and amusing He said the artist insisted on painting in the figurative style rather than in the abstract style favoured by many of his contemporaries Edmund Capon told the memorial Jeffrey Smart took a solitary and independent journey in the Australian art world He took us on an enigmatic journey around familiar territory Mr Capon said Mr Smarts long term partner Ermes de Zan attended todays memorial in Canberra   Topicscontemporary artdeathcanberra 2600act     First posted           November 29 2013 161233       More stories from Australian Capital Territory

Sunshine Coast councillor Tony Wellington says the new Noosa council will swiftly address the issue of low flying helicopters on the north shore Residents are angry training flights are regularly being held over populated areas at night Mr Wellington says it is an issue that needs to be fixed Unfortunately much of the helicopter training involves night training and once the helicopters pass the Noosa River and head north theyre in largely uncontrolled airspace and theyre using that area for low level flying and often flying in formation and you can imagine what thats like for poor residents at night he said The opportunity now exists for the new Noosa council to consider controls to be placed on Teewah Airstrip There is a long standing agreement by council to return that area to national park because it is in fact embedded in the Cooloola section of the Great Sandy National Park Topicslocal governmentair transportnoosa heads 4567maroochydore 4558   More stories from Queensland

<TEXT>
Federal MP Bruce Scott says a waste treatment plant in Queenslands southern inland should be on property owned by the coal seam gas CSG industry Waste from mining camps will be stored in evaporation ponds at a site 20 kilometres north of Roma The Maranoa Regional Council says while it had strong objections it could not reject the project because it was approved by the State Government Mr Scott the LNP Member for Maranoa says the plant is necessary because of an increase in the resource workforce and the industry should take responsibility for it These CSG companies are very large landholders now owning many hundreds of thousands of acres he said If its acceptable as a way of disposing of this raw sewage then it should be located on CSG company land He says it is the council that decides on the location of the facility We need the council to accept that it is their decision that they made he said I know the community will not accept this and there will be appeals and whatever action has to be taken I know the people of Roma and around the district where this is proposed are certainly ready to take up the fight and reject this Topicsrecycling and waste managementurban development and planningactivism and lobbyinglocal governmentfederal governmentroma 4455toowoomba 4350   More stories from Queensland
