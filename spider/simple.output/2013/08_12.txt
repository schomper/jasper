<DOC_NAME>State Water defends pricing application to ACCC</DOC_NAME>
<TEXT>
State Water is defending its application to the ACCC to increase water charges in the Peel Valley The increase if approved by the ACCC would see water usage costs in the Peel Valley rise by 79 per cent Local irrigators and Tamworth Regional Council say this is inequitable with a proposed general security regulated water charge for irrigators next year of 7434 a megalitre compared to 246 a megalitre in the Murray State Water is also proposing a change in its tariff ratio to more reliance on fixed charges But spokesman Tony Webber says its too early to talk of potential rises Its really speculative at this stage and its worth noting that in the past weve been ordered to find efficiencies he said So its certainly not a rubber stamp by any means and we need to justify every dollar we spend Tony Webber says the corporation has given careful consideration to its proposed fee structure Weve put forward our position and the ACCC is the independent arbiter that will determine whether or not the costs that were proposing for example to run our operation are prudent he said Its also worth noting that since State Water was corporatised in 2004 weve only recouped our costs on one occasion in one year but we still have to meet those largely static operating costs regardless Topicswaterwater managementstates and territoriesmurray darling basinkootingal 2352nundle 2340tamworth 2340bendemeer 2355duri 2344     First posted           December 08 2013 224615       More stories from New South Wales

<DOC_NAME>Impossible to guarantee no school will be worse off under Coalition funding arrangements</DOC_NAME>
<TEXT>
In the last of a spectacular series of backflips on December 2 Prime Minister Tony Abbott agreed to honour agreements Labor had made with four states and the ACT to introduce school funding reforms recommended by the Gonski review over the next four years Mr Abbott also pledged an extra 12 billion in school funding for the Northern Territory and the two states that had not signed agreements with Labor Opposition Leader Bill Shorten says the Government is still breaking an election promise Theres one question which Tony Abbott refuses to answer theres one promise that hes clearly not keeping Mr Shorten said The Coalition Government just need to say now to Australians what they said before the election that no school will be worse off   The Gonski education reforms aim to place Australia in the top five countries internationally in reading mathematics and science by 2025  They are based on a needs based funding model called the schooling resource standard This gives a base level of funding for each student with provisions for extra funding for disadvantaged students   This may include a loading for students with a disability low socio economic status or limited English language proficiency Former prime minister Julia Gillard said in April the base payments would be 9271 per primary school student and 12193 per high school student  New South Wales was the first state to sign an agreement in April Subsequent agreements with Victoria South Australia Tasmania and the ACT required the states to maintain existing levels of funding and commit to increasing it by 3 per cent a yearThe Commonwealth committed to a 47 per cent rise in school funding The federal government required the states to provide 35 per cent of the additional funding   After Labor committed to the Gonski model in April Coalition education spokesman Christopher Pyne spent months calling Labors needs based funding model a conski not a Gonski He said it was a massive grab for power by Canberra and predicted no states would sign agreements On August 2 with an election announcement imminent and several states signed up to the Gonski model Mr Abbott changed the Coalitions rhetoric and announced it was on a unity ticket with Labor on school funding As far as I am concerned as far as Christopher Pyne is concerned as far as the Coalition is concerned we want to end the uncertainty by guaranteeing that no school will be worse off over the forward estimates he said So we will honour the agreements that Labor has entered into We will match the offers that Labor has made We will make sure that no school is worse off A statement issued the same day said the Coalition would dismantle all command and control features imposed by Labor on the states territories and non government schools and any new funding will not be conditional upon a deal which reduces their authority over schools or creates unnecessary red tape   After the Coalition won the election Mr Pyne said on November 24 he was going back to the drawing board on school funding  Under pressure to repeat the election promise that no school would be worse off Mr Pyne said his Government would remove command and control from Canberra and treat state and territory governments like adults We will have exactly the same funding envelope as Labor but each state and territory applies the model the way they see fit he said on November 27 Thats the way Labor set it up Thats the Shorten shambles that I am facing So its impossible to ask the federal minister for education to make a commitment that no school will be worse off because the federal minister doesnt decide that The Coalitions change of direction provoked strong criticism from the states that had signed agreements with Labor and fears that funding earmarked for them would be transferred to other states  On December 2 Mr Abbott announced in principle agreements with Queensland Northern Territory and Western Australia He placated the other states by confirming the funding that Labor had pledged them for four years and by committing an extra 12 billion under the three new in principle agreements The new federal funding would have no strings attached he said The unconditional agreements with Queensland Northern Territory and Western Australia have raised concerns that with extra federal funding on the way state funding might be moved out of schools and spent elsewhere leaving schools with the same or lower funding  The opposition spokeswoman for education Kate Ellis says the no strings attached funding means the Government can no longer pledge every school will get the same amount of funding as it would have under Labor They cannot reassure the parents and students of schools right around Australia they will honour their word Now unless in the latest agreements that theyve made they have guaranteed that state governments cannot cut education budgets they cannot make that promise she said But Mr Abbott says he doesnt want to run schools from Canberra We would certainly regard it as very poor form for the states to reduce their funding because they are getting extra funding from the Commonwealth but what we dont want is to try to run public schools out of Canberra and that was the problem with the original deal that the former government did he said on December 2 There were inspectors from Canberra there was a whole lot of extra data gathering from Canberra Mr Pyne said the same day Every school in Australia will get more funding and will not be worse off because of anything that the Commonwealth does As you would know the states in the end apply the model but what the Commonwealth is doing means that no school state or territory can be worse off because of the Commonwealths actions Professor Richard Teese director of the University of Melbournes Centre for Research on Education Systems told Fact Check removing command and control is just relaxing the obligations the state governments have to the national schooling resource standard and thats really worrying Professor Teese whose research was used by the Gonski review says the Gonski model is national and thats the whole point It didnt differ with the different jurisdictions it didnt differ with respect to public and private systems The Coalition Government has also not committed to honouring the Gonski agreements for years five and six when the majority of the 145 billion funding falls Correct During the election campaign Mr Abbott promised that no school would be worse off and that the Coalition would honour the agreements that Labor had entered into and match the offers Labor had made The Coalition has since refused to promise that no school will be worse off than it would have been under Labors Gonski school funding plans Without requiring states to contribute state funds to increase them over time and to commit to funding up to the schooling resource standard it is impossible for the Commonwealth to guarantee that no school will be worse off than under Labor  ABC PM Education experts unclear on Pynes plans November 28 2013   Topicsschoolseducational resourceseducationfederal governmentalpbill shortenaustralia     First posted

<DOC_NAME>The Ashes: England's batting and bowling needs boost ahead of third Test at the WACA</DOC_NAME>
<TEXT>
England has forced a fifth day in Adelaide but the questions about the tourists ahead of the Perth Test have been set Rain unbelievable resilience or a combination of both are the only things that can prevent Australia from heading to the WACA Ground with a 2 0 advantage Two of Englands most important batsmen Alastair Cook and Kevin Pietersen have under performed during the seven matches into the back to back series In a similar way to Australias quandary here three years ago the improvement to the batting will not be sought at selection Cook displayed further evidence of Mitchell Johnsons toying with the tourists minds through his second innings dismissal The captains premeditated counter attack to the short ball came unstuck with an uncharacteristic and uncontrolled horizontal bat shot For a man of Cooks importance and class 359 runs at 256 in the last seven Tests falls short of a pass The skippers four previous innings in Perth have featured one dig of significance  Cook made 116 in the second innings in 2006 after a first innings 15 The WACA produced a modest return on his plundering tour three years ago with contributions of 32 and 13 Pietersens recent numbers are better but in a batting order with greenhorns around him he is not fulfilling the role the team demands of a player of his experience The question has been asked of Pietersen before but it is relevant once more   can the ego cope with the fact he needs to bat in partnerships and not just for himself Graeme Swanns role will come into question He played at the WACA in 2010 and picked up just two wickets for the match  If England decide to play a spinner Monty Panesar might be the one The leftie is not as consistent as Swann but Panesar looked more threatening in Adelaide and he has good memories of Perth Its not the memory of his second innings dismissal the wicket that saw the Ashes return to Australia but rather his bowling where he picked up eight wickets in the match James Anderson and Stuart Broad are locks Tim Bresnan is likely to return so it seems the spinners and the tall quicks of Steve Finn Chris Tremlett and Boyd Rankin will fight it out for the fourth specialist bowling role England did have one win on day four in Adelaide aided by Michael Clarkes decision not to enforce the follow on by forcing Australias bowlers to go to work another day with a quick turnaround imminent Topicssportcricketashesadelaide 5000saperth 6000waaustraliaengland     First posted           December 08 2013 213116       More stories from South Australia

<DOC_NAME>Nelson Mandela united Springboks for underdog 1995 World Cup victory over All Blacks</DOC_NAME>
<TEXT>
For South Africans winning the 1995 Rugby World Cup final marked the emergence of the Rainbow Nation for New Zealanders it was the day Nelson Mandela single handedly out psyched the mighty All Blacks The Jonah Lomu inspired New Zealanders were red hot favourites going into the decider breezing through the group stages and humiliating England in the semi finals In contrast the Springboks scraped through on the back of an unconvincing 19 15 semi final win over France raising fears they would be blown away in the final at Johannesburgs Ellis Park Then Mandela in one of the most audacious political gambles of his career appeared before the mostly white crowd of 62000 wearing a Springbok jersey to shake the players hands before kick off The then All Blacks coach Laurie Mains said the atmosphere in the stadium was electric as South Africas first black president sported a garment that was indelibly associated with the apartheid regime The Springboks won the game 15 12 thanks to a Joel Stransky drop goal deep into extra time The two countries have been going head to head since 1921 But when Australia and other nations cut their sporting ties with South Africa during apartheid New Zealand did not   In the 1960s South African rugby union excluded Maori rugby players from touring with the All Blacks to South Africa For the 1970 tour a compromise solution was devised and Maori players were considered honorary whites but this angered many In 1981 a Springbok team was permitted to tour New Zealand and protests against the tour reached a level unparalleled in New Zealand history It was the last time the teams would play while South Africa was still under apartheid I remember when the plane touched down in Johannesburg it all hit me all at once and I had what youd describe as a panic attack   Bryan Williams was 19 years old when he was selected for the controversial 1970 All Blacks tour of South Africa  Because of his Samoan heritage Williams had to play as an honorary white as did three Maori team mates   Williams says he despised apartheid but the lure of the All Blacks jersey was too strong I remember when the plane touched down in Johannesburg it all hit me all at once and I had what youd describe as a panic attack he said I saw the opportunity I guess to go to South Africa and show people that people of my skin colour could compete just as well as they could and hopefully better The young Polynesian New Zealander was electrifying He scored 14 tries in 13 matches  Enthusiastic mixed race fans hoisted him onto their shoulders   only to be set upon by a white mob Before we knew it all hell had broken loose and there were police and dogs and batons and people lying on the ground and that sort of thing he said That was a very graphic reminder of how volatile the situation was in South Africa In June 1976 defying international calls for a boycott the All Blacks toured again   just two weeks after the apartheid regimes slaughter of protesting students in Soweto New Zealand got an enormous backlash internationally said John Minto who was a prominent New Zealand anti apartheid campaigner There was an attempt to have us thrown out of the Montreal Olympics and when they failed to get New Zealand kicked out 29 countries boycotted the Olympics because of that   Mr Minto says the controversial tours of the 1970s set the stage for the explosive Springbok tour of New Zealand in 1981   The country was so bitterly divided he said There was really no room on the fence at all People were either strongly for the tour or strongly against it   Over eight weeks 150000 pro and anti tour demonstrators did battle on the streets and rugby fields of New Zealand and 2000 people were arrested  When anti apartheid protesters invaded the pitch in Hamilton and prevented the second game of the tour going ahead emotions boiled over It was absolute mayhem I ended up going to hospital twice that night to get stiches after attacks from pro tour thugs Mr Minto said Mandela said that when the game was cancelled he said all the prisoners on Robben Island grabbed the doors of their cells and they rattled them right round the prison and it was like the sun came out Mr Minto said It was a moment Mandela recalled when visiting New Zealand in 1995 as president of a post apartheid South Africa You stood in the trenches with us and ensured that a crime against humanity was buried forever never to return he said  Former New Zealand prime minister Jim Bolger who was a minister in the Muldoon government that had condoned the Springbok tour felt compelled to apologise But by 1995 the sport which had divided South Africa and New Zealand was again a unifying force When the Springboks beat the All Blacks in Johannesburg to hold aloft the Rugby World Cup no one seemed happier than Mandela himself ABCwires Topicsrugby leaguesportworld politicssouth africanew zealand     First posted           December 08 2013 200918
