<TEXT>
Two Turkish ministers resigned on Wednesday after their sons were arrested in a corruption investigation that has pitted the government against the judiciary and rattled foreign investors Interior minister Muammer Guler and economy minister Zafer Caglayan each had a son among 24 people arrested on graft charges on December 17 in a case involving the chief of state run lender Halkbank Neither minister has been implicated and both say their sons are innocent Prime minister Tayyip Erdogan has responded to the investigation by purging police officers involved including the chief of the force in Istanbul Halkbanks headquarters The Erdogan government portrays the scandal as a foreign orchestrated effort to sow discord in Turkey The country has flourished economically during the Islamist rooted premiers three terms though he has been accused of authoritarianism I have resigned from my post of economy minister to help the  truth to come out and to foil this ugly plot which has impacted my child and my close work colleagues among others Mr Caglayan said in a statement In a separate statement Mr Guler called the affair a dirty set up against our government party and country With international trading on hold for Christmas the resignations were unlikely to have a strong market impact in Turkey The lira had plunged to an all time low of 20983 against the dollar on Friday but rallied to 20801 on Tuesday Among many Turks the affair has reignited anti Erdogan sentiment that had simmered since the mid 2013 mass protests against his rule It also drew an EU warning that Ankara needed to safeguard the separation of powers Political analysts see some sapping of popular support for Mr Erdogans AK Party but no immediate threat to the government The scandal could however hurt AKs standing in local elections due in March The next national ballot is in 2015 Moving to salve the domestic divisions president Abdullah Gul pledged on Tuesday that there would be no cover up and that the investigation would be adjudicated in independent courts Reuters Topicscorruptionbankingworld politics

<DOC_NAME>Thailand extends security law in response to mass opposition protests</DOC_NAME>
<TEXT>
A senior official in Thailand says a special security law has been extended for two more months to cope with mass opposition protests aimed at overthrowing Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra Ms Yingluck has faced weeks of rallies drawing tens of thousands of her opponents onto the streets They are seeking to oust her elected government and install an unelected peoples council in its place The protests   aimed at curbing the political influence of Yinglucks family   have left five people dead and more than 200 wounded in street violence although tensions have abated recently The special law known as the Internal Security Act was widened a month ago to cover the whole of Bangkok and nearby areas It gives the police additional powers to block routes ban gatherings carry out searches and impose a curfew although not all the measures have been used The government needs this law to oversee peace and order because there are still protests Deputy Defence Minister General Yutthasak Sasiprapa told reporters after the cabinet agreed on a 60 day extension Ms Yingluck has called a snap election for February 2 to try to ease tensions but the main opposition Democrat Party   which has not won an elected majority in about two decades   has vowed to boycott the vote The protesters have tried to stop candidates signing up for the election by blocking the entrances to the stadium serving as a registration venue Demonstrators tried to force their way into the building on Wednesday triggering scuffles with police   Election authorities however have expressed confidence that candidates will be able to register in time The political conflict broadly pits a Bangkok based middle class and elite against rural and poor voters loyal to Ms Yinglucks brother Thaksin Shinawatra who was ousted as prime minister in a coup in 2006 and lives in self exile The protesters accuse the billionaire tycoon turned politician of corruption and say he controls his sisters government from his base in Dubai The recent unrest is the worst since 2010 when more than 90 civilians were killed in a bloody military crackdown on pro Thaksin protests under the previous Democrat Party led government Pro Thaksin parties have won every election since 2001 most recently with a landslide victory under Ms Yingluck two years ago The protesters want loosely defined reforms   such as an end to alleged vote buying   before new elections are held in around a year to 18 months Ms Yingluck on Wednesday proposed a national reform council made up of 499 representatives from various sectors to recommend constitutional amendments and economic and legal reforms as well as anti corruption measures She said the body would be set up in parallel with a February 2 general election It is now time to develop a mechanism to push forward and mobilise national reform she said in an address to the nation But the plan was immediately rejected by protest leaders who want reforms before elections in a bid to curb the political influence of the prime ministers family Ms Yingluck is not sincere about reform said a spokesman for the protest movement Akanat Promphan The prime minister can show her responsibility and sacrifice by stepping down so that the reform process can begin he added Even some of Ms Yinglucks supporters criticised the proposed selection process for the 499 member reform council which will be supervised by 11 representatives from the military civil service business and other sectors All 11 people are from the Thai elite and have nothing to do with the Thai people said Thida Thavornseth chairwoman of the Red Shirt political movement which is broadly loyal to Thaksin  This could cool the political temperature but in reality only the people want reform   not the elite she said stressing the importance of the February election    AFP Topicspolicegovernment and politicselectionsunrest conflict and warthailandasia     First posted           December 25 2013 221328
