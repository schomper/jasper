If Labor fails heed lessons federal election tries hamstring Coalitions reform agenda heading second drubbing double dissolution writes Peter Reith There four changeovers government last 30 years In 1983 Hawke defeated PM Fraser 90 seats adjusting size Parliament Howard defeated Hawkes successor Paul Keating won equivalent 95 seats Rudd defeated Howard 83 seats Abbotts winning number 90 91 Labor 2013 thrashed convincingly Howard 2007 yet Coalition abided result whereas Labor refuses concede anything blindingly obvious fact public like political parties fight amongst themselves Labor denial even Bob Hawke said Labor suffered massive loss needed reflect future There better example Labors delusions Tanya Plibersek summed Labors self belief said ABC election night I would give us 910 governing country Hardly anybody outside Labor ranks would agree her It one died following Labors change boat people policy one died pink batts disaster closure live cattle trade consequences waste billions dollars never occurred school halls debacle Seriously delusional people Does Tanya ever think maybe Labor lost many Australians enough incompetence Does Labor really think starting campaign news huge blowout deficit would irrelevant Does Labor seriously think scare campaign jobs credible Labors estimates unemployment rising It seems not Certainly reaction Labor since Saturday night learn nothing experience forget past instead soldier on regardless public opinion The fact Labors primary vote 338 lowest since 1903 also seems irrelevant Labors delusion surprise me Since end Hawke Keating years Labor anti economic reform consumed so called progressive policies aligned Greens reverting protectionism xenophobia Labor run union apparatchiks public standing continue ebb away But necessarily quickly It early hope Labors malaise bring Labor knees signs middle road centre left party fill place So sort political culture seen recent years continue Labor leaders future better discredited Latham Gillard Rudd Labor oppose every economic reform proposed Abbott Government You see happened Hawke Opposition support measure request reform taken further The irony whilst Labor tried and failed paint Abbott negative negativity Labor reach new lows Labor ruthlessly negative throughout Abbotts time Lodge Fortunately Howard precedent pro reform government still achieve significant reform regardless Labors tactics As long Abbott retains public support evidence public want continuing economic reform maintain Australias competitiveness Labor keen see Australian manufacturing go paying carbon tax oppose abolition carbon tax And want revenue resources sector via mining tax unions demand Labor oppose return ABCC requirement militant unions observe law Abbotts modest labour market reforms also strongly opposed might well put double dissolution DD well paid parental leave It would make 2014 DD rerun 2013 without Rudd Abbott win contests even takes DD The Senate continuing institution I wondering maybe Abbott put four pieces legislation House Representatives Christmas The Senate could committee process hear reasons carbon tax kept put bills vote early next year If rejected Abbott test new senators July 2014 It would mean double dissolution could spring next year first Hockey budget The Senate committee process burden government ambitions Some Abbotts proposal could tinkering within framework said would do The reform waterfront late 1990s required changes workplace practices nick time Today unions boast get wage increases without productivity The MUA back business waterfront bottle necks created MUA undermining offshore resources sector WA The Coalition idea Fair Work Commission require productivity improvements part agreements third rate response national imperative The idea FWC answer Australias productivity malaise flies face pro reform measures supported Labor Coalition late 1980s 2007 By means ask FWC raise issue competition labour market product markets provide adequate response major problem facing economy Another proposal Coalition introduce arbitration final resort settle greenfields agreements The time limits introduced Coalition help big resource projects providing reversion albeit limited arbitration unfortunate It throwback discredited idea arbitration future Instead Coalition resume support Keatings simple idea FWC set minimum wages conditions beyond matter negotiation With fresh mandate second half 2014 Abbott could pursue renewed economic agenda based Productivity Commission reports
