<DOC_NAME>Government accused of breaking election promise over Japanese whaling in Southern Ocean</DOC_NAME>
<TEXT>
The Federal Government has been accused of breaking an election promise by sending a plane instead of a boat to monitor Japanese whaling in the Southern Ocean The Government will send an A319 plane to the Southern Ocean during the whaling season which begins in January and ends in March in an effort to step up its monitoring of whaling fleets Environment Minister Greg Hunt says the Government is acting in the absence of a decision against whaling by the International Court of Justice He says it is important Australia has a monitoring presence in the area given the risk of confrontation between whalers and anti whaling protesters in order to ensure both parties obey the law   It will be to ensure that there is a presence to make sure that there is no conflict between the parties he said  It will also be to make sure there is an awareness between the parties that the world is watching In the lead up to the election the Coalition promised to send a Customs vessel to the area Under Australian law such a vessel would have to turn around any Japanese ship that conducted illegal whaling Greens Senator Peter Wish Wilson says sending a plane will have a limited impact and the Government has a boat ready made for such a mission  The taxpayers paid 150 million for a purpose built vessel thats designed to operate in Antarctic waters he said Now at the moment its been seconded by Scott Morrison the Minister for Immigration to act as a tropical water taxi off Christmas Island   Sea Shepherd campaigner Jeff Hansen says a plane will not be able to adequately monitor the situation and that Mr Hunt has broken a pre election promise to send a boat  Hunt put out a clear statement that a Customs vessel needed to be down there there is no Customs vessel down there Mr Hansen said  Theres no repercussions for Japan their violence will be escalating and that pre election promise has been broken This sending planes overhead is a really pathetic response and its really a waste of taxpayers dollars Sea Shepherd is already doing that job  Sea Shepherd campaigners set off for Antarctic waters on Wednesday saying they expected increased aggression from the Japanese fleet after their harassment tactics kept the cull to a record low last season The hunt netted just 103 minke whales less than half its tally the previous year and no fin whales with Japanese authorities blaming unforgivable sabotage by activists A number of nations have recently warned environmentalists and whalers against taking action that endangers human life High seas clashes between the groups are common and Sea Shepherd   which has sent three ships to the Antarctic this year   regularly pelts the whaling ships with stink bombs attempts to foul their propellers and manoeuvres vessels between harpoons and whales     Topicsinternational lawenvironmentconservationwhalinggovernment and politicsfederal governmentaustraliajapan     First posted           December 22 2013 183501
