<DOC_NAME>Rafael Nadal loses first match of the season with straight sets defeat by David Ferrer in Abu Dhabi</DOC_NAME>
<TEXT>
Rafael Nadal got his season underway with a 6 4 6 4 loss to fellow Spaniard David Ferrer in the semi finals of the Mubadala World Tennis Championship exhibition tournament in Abu Dhabi It was the world number ones first match since losing in straight sets to Novak Djokovic in the final of the World Tour Finals in London on November 11 Playing ahead of the official ATP season opener in nearby Doha next week Ferrer looked the sharper from the start breaking in the ninth game to take the first set It was more of the same in the second set as Nadal struggled to find his range against an opponent who already had a match under his belt having defeated Stanislas Wawrinka in the quarter finals on Thursday I think for a first match to play against a guy who has practised for a month and who played a match yesterday on a very fast court I was happy with how I played Nadal told The National newspaper I had a few opportunities break points but he played well and he converted the chances better than me I had a few mistakes but in my opinion I was better than I thought I would be right now Ferrer goes on to play Djokovic who was being watched by new coach Boris Becker in Saturdays final after the world number two defeated Jo Wilfried Tsonga 7 6 75 6 3 He has one of the strongest serves in the game and its very precise said Djokovic I exceeded my own expectations My performance today was great Ferrer who announced last week that he was splitting with long time coach Javier Piles in a bid to finally win a Grand Slam title said he had been helped by having already played in the tournament I think the fact that I had already played a match on the same surface meant that I was better prepared than Rafa said Ferrer I am happy with the state of my game and will look to produce my best tennis for the final In earlier action Andy Murray chalked up his first win since returning to action after a three month injury lay off by defeating Switzerlands Wawrinka 6 3 6 4 The 26 year old Wimbledon champion had back surgery in September and did not play again until he lost to Tsonga in the quarter finals on Thursday Wawrinka lost to Ferrer on the same day and the match between him and Murray was to decide who would finish fifth in the unofficial three day tournament that saw Nadal and Djokovic joining in at the semi final stage Murray looked much sharper against Wawrinka than he had looked in the second set against Tsonga and had little difficulty in seeing off the challenge of the world number eight The world number four got the better of three successive breaks to take the first set and then forged ahead again with a break for 4 3 in the second Wawrinka saved a match point on his own serve with a forehand winner but Murray confidently served out for the victory In a courtside interview Murray said I feel pretty good a lot better than I did a few months ago I just need to play more matches like this because the intensitys a lot higher than you can get in practice It was good to get two matches against top players Everyone needs matches at this stage especially me Its been a perfect start and hopefully Ill get better Murray will next make the short trip over to Doha where he will play in the AFP season opener tournament along with Nadal AFP Topicssporttennisunited arab emirates

<TEXT>
Pentagon chief Chuck Hagel has hailed a decision by Japanese officials to allow the relocation of a US air base in Okinawa saying it was a milestone for relations with Tokyo Mr Hagel welcomed the approval of the long delayed move of the US Marine Corps base which he said would permit a redeployment of American forces in the area and bolster Washingtons strategic rebalance to the Asia Pacific region Reaching this milestone is a clear demonstration to the region that the alliance is capable of handling complex difficult problems in order to deal effectively with 21st century security challenges Mr Hagel said in a statement Our alliance has helped underwrite regional peace stability and prosperity for more than half a century and resolving these years long issues will enable us to take our relationship to the next level as we revise the guidelines for US Japan defense cooperation he said After more than 17 years of debate and political wrangling the local government in Okinawa has given a green light to moving the Futenma air station from a densely populated urban area to a new facility to be constructed on the coast  Mr Hagel said he had told Japanese officials that the Pentagon was committed to working with the government of Japan to build a strong and sustainable US military presence with less impact on the people of Okinawa Relocating the controversial air base is part of a plan to reduce the overall US military presence in Okinawa The number of Marines on the island is expected to decrease from 18000 to about 10000 in coming years as some will be sent to Australia and the US territory of Guam Resolving the future of the air base in Okinawa clears the way for Washingtons so called pivot to Asia with plans to deploy more ships and troops in the Pacific  The realignment effort is absolutely critical to the United States ongoing rebalance to the Asia Pacific region and our ability to maintain a geographically distributed operationally resilient and politically sustainable force posture in the region Mr Hagel said The rebalance is designed to counter Chinas growing military might and influence in the Pacific amid growing tensions over territorial disputes US defense officials called Japans decision a landmark step that would remove a sensitive time consuming issue from the agenda in Washington Tokyo relations It opens up the bandwidth at a senior level for other issues to be discussed said a senior official who spoke on condition of anonymity The agreement calls for moving to a new base on Okinawas northern coast by 2022 but if Japanese construction efforts move at a faster pace the United States would be ready to move earlier officials said AFP Topicsworld politicsterritorial disputesair forcedefence forcesjapanasiaunited statespacificaustraliaguam
