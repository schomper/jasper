<DOC_NAME>Song contest to help combat violence against women</DOC_NAME>
<TEXT>
The United Nations has launched a new song competition in Bougainville to encourage more women to participate in the largely male dominated local music industry A cash prize is being offered to the best song that tackles one of two themes real men dont hit women or empowering women and the winner will be announced on White Ribbon Day on November 25 Agnes Titus from the UN Women in Bougainville told Pacific Beat she believe the song contest will make an impact and so far many entries have been received from both men and women    We got a good number of entrants and basically all are singing about ending violence against women she said  They go on to talk about violence against women Its a terrible thing it doesnt allow women to enjoy what they duly are supposed to enjoy here on this earth Ms Titus says there is a need to encourage women to get into the music industry  We actually have because music is part of our life here we just really need to encourage women to go more into the industry she said  We have some good musicians already female musicians but we really need to get more to come out Ms Titus says the organizers are happy that men have also shown interest in the competition  I think the onus here is really for us to get men to own the fact that they become too violent in their lives and that they do not know how to control their anger and often this anger results in violence against women and children she said When we make the announcement of what group has won the song competition we want to see more men out there too who will wear the white ribbon because we are telling the men it means you make a personal commitment to end violence if you are a violent person to end it in your family in the community among your peers Ms Titus says Bougainville is quite a violent place and the song contest is one small approach to tackle the issue of sexual violence  We believe the more we go out there to promote ending violence against women we will certainly we do have a hope that we will make a difference she said  This song contest is just one of the many approaches that were engaging here We have got partners who are working tirelessly to do campaigning on ending violence against women Topicsdomestic violencecommunity and societypacific     First posted           November 22 2013 144817

<DOC_NAME>Upper House votes down bid to make it harder to sack public servants</DOC_NAME>
<TEXT>
Tasmanias public sector union says a move to kill off the State Governments bid to make it harder to sack public servants shows a lack of respect The Governments bill to reverse its own 2011 changes to public sector job contracts was comprehensively defeated by the Upper House last night Independent Tony Mulder and others suggested there was no need to make it harder to sack bureaucrats  I know of people who are basically doing the same job they did 40 or 50 years ago but theyre now about four or five pay scales up the tree he said  The CPSUs Tom Lynch says it is disappointing that MLCs voted down the move He says it sends a bad message to public servants It shows that the majority of Members of the Legislative Council do not respect Tasmanias public sector workers dont respect their role within our community All it was doing was restoring what had been there prior to the emergency in 2011 the same provisions that have been there since 2000 and I think our members will be quite concerned not just about what they did but about some of the negative things that were said about public servants in the Legislative Council The Premier Lara Giddings says she is disappointed but the vote would not affect the Governments no redundancy commitment made in March The State Government has not wavered in its commitment to no forced redundancies she said The State Service Act was changed in response to a short term budget challenge but I am pleased to say that it was never used and no public servants were made forcibly redundant It is disappointing members of the Legislative Council have not supported a return to the status quo now that there are signs that the budget is returning to a sustainable footing Topicspublic sectorunionsstate parliamenttas     First posted           November 22 2013 072701       More stories from Tasmania
