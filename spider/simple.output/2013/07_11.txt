much problems except using Guantanamo Bay USA showed poor light It supposed icon truth justice  freedom made constitution statement hypocrisy holding trials USA civil lawWith passion accused would still found guilty due process would followed Alert moderator 07 Nov 2013 13112pm Sounds like bit history war me gets control version events weve every reason ashamed constantly tried push background I think seems quite obvious Howard probably every reason suspect may known details simply busy political equivalent putting finger ears singing loudly drown information His sympathies US may exceeded populace represented considerable amount As I suspect saw creating kind disagreement pointlessly divisive given already committing troops resources confected war Iraq As competing narrative innocence Hicks side reason think charges levelled excessive ill founded making possible clear name legal sense possibly therefore claim form compensation But ask people form foolishness would bring anyone proximate terrorism appeared theres big difference legally innocent specific charges rescuing innocence ones character eyes many think exhibited ill intent siding wrong peopleI think major disconnect twofold Firstly way government acted disapproval extraordinary rendition torture But secondly also kind involvement Australians would deem appropriate resisting wars disagreement degree Hicks willing get involved With mind I think neither side debate telling story much resembles truth Alert moderator 07 Nov 2013 64847pm Perhaps Howard swayed te sight people jumping deaths avoid burnt alive Would unreasonable Alert moderator 07 Nov 2013 83340pm It might unreasonable one apportioned blame incorrectly case Iraq Al Qaeda links WMD ever actually located theres quite difference suspected intent smoking gunHicks hand found Afghanistan reference Im making events overlapped period incarcerated allegedly tortured I think theres relatively little doubt tortured Im trying even handed muddy waters matters may disagree upon theres pivotal point I think must conceded Howard At time Howard best ignore Hicks interests Australian citizen incarcerated clear contravention rights US government lead virtually nose Iraq conflict without much whimper dissent its ministers despite widespread protest within electorate Thats mindset Im lamenting here We got illegal war way wasnt plain subservient US least downright careless widely supported citizens country That kind background comes much fore interrogating matter Howard pretty much allowed US whatever liked Hicks point political deal struck wrap proceedings As whether I think sympathetic groups far removed Taliban good idea Nobody does said did cares much defend extremism If were reasonable wed rather saying loitering without intent isnt activity appropriately attracts rendition torture even incarceration without due process enemy combatant What done Hicks wasnt facts offence committed It offended Westerner would keep company Muslim radicals kind granted 911 unreasonable permission hate As actions taken Hicks kind credible threat mob boss employs kneecapping Its authority saying citizenry kind disloyal act severe summary
