<DOC_NAME>OFC hits back at Tuvalu over FIFA bid</DOC_NAME>
<TEXT>
The Oceania Football Confederation has hit back at claims its thwarting Tuvalus bid to join the world governing body FIFA Tuvalu wants a FIFA membership so it can compete in the Oceania Cup and World Cup qualifying The OFC General Secretary Tai Nicholas says his organisation is doing everything it can to help Tuvalu But he says the lack of infrastructure in the country is the main problem The problem with Tuvalu is that its so small they cant find the available space to put a stadium Mr Nicholas told Pacific Beat  Thats why they train on the airport  When the plane lands they have to leave and they can go back and train when the plane takes off again  Tuvalus campaign to join FIFA has been backed for the last four years by a group of sympathisers from the Netherlands who call themselves the Dutch Support Tuvalu Foundation Paul Driessen is part of that group and is now working for Tuvalu Football Association  The problem with Tuvalu is that its so small thats why they train on the airport Last week he accused the OFC of not supporting Tuvalus ambitions I dont know exactly why but maybe it gives them a lot of administrative work he told Pacific Beat Its quite clear that Tuvalu doesnt receive a lot of support For example the OFC never promotes Tuvalu in any single way on their website and theres very little communication and thats quite frustrating But Mr Nicholas says his organisation is doing everything it can to help Tuvalu Its very disappointing that he makes these comments in the media when he knows full well what the requirements are he said We provide financial grants to them every year we provide technical courses footballs coaching courses  We actually even help pay for them to come to OFC tournaments  Mr Nicholas says its not just the lack of international standard facilities that is the problem All the 11 OFC members have stadiums they have hotels they have airports they have connections he said  So if we say tomorrow can you host a New Zealand team or a Cook Islands team Tuvalu says that they cant  Unfortunately theres not one hotel which a team could stay in in Tuvalu But the OFC says its eager to continue working with Tuvalu in its bid Were keen to invest some money to help get a stadium and if were talking about 200000 or 300000 then were happy to facilitate and find these funds so Tuvalu can get a membership Mr Nicholas said But the problem with Tuvalu football at this present time is they havent even submitted a formal application to FIFA because the last file is incomplete Topicssoccersoccer world cuptuvalunew zealandpacific     First posted           December 18 2013 124858
