The Department of Agriculture has imposed additional conditions on sheep exports to Jordan while an investigation into alleged welfare breaches is underway At an Estimates hearing in Canberra the Department of Agriculture confirmed that as the regulator under the ESCAS live export welfare system it has launched two separate investigations against Livestock Shipping Services LSS in relation to alleged leakage from approved supply chains in Jordan In June and October 2013 animal rights group Animals Australia provided footage to the department that it alleges shows Australian sheep being slaughtered outside of approved facilities in Jordan Greens Senator Lee Rhiannon an opponent of the live export trade asked Agriculture Department officials what action they took between receiving the first and second complaints to address the issue Rebecca Irwin the first assistant secretary with the departments live animal export division said that in addition to launching two ongoing investigations to establish the veracity and circumstances of each complaint additional conditions were imposed on sheep exports to Jordan For exporters of sheep to Jordan at the moment the regulator requires a range of conditions that exporters need to meet They include additional supply chain officers in country locations additional reporting on reconciliation back to the regulator and following the most recent complaint exporters have to have a specific exporters identification marking on sheep that are exported she said The other thing the committee would appreciate is that the regulator has the ability to approve supply chains of varying sizes For example some exporters may have a supply chain that has two feedlots and three abattoirs  What the regulator has done for live sheep exports to Jordan is to require the exporter to have all their sheep processed through one feedlot and one abattoir That reduces the risk of potential issues happening The hearing was told that Jordan is currently Australias third largest market for live sheep with approximately 265000 head sent there so far this year  So far in this calendar year approximately 600000 sheep have been exported to Kuwait and 424000 to Qatar  Oman has received 28000 while closer to home 20000 sheep have been sent to Malaysia so far this year Departmental officials told the hearing that Australia has exported approximately 15 million live sheep to all markets so far in 2013 Thats down on 2012 21 million and 2011 24 million The committee was told that a range of factors affect exports from year to year including the value of the Australian dollar conditions set by importing countries and the availability of sheep for export The value of all live exports   sheep cattle and goats   was 783 million in 2012 13 the committee heard according to the latest figures from the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics and Sciences ABARES  Thats forecast to rise to 884 million in 2013 14 Departmental officials also faced questions from senators about the abolition of the Australian Animal Welfare Advisory Council AusAWAC which brought together industry veterinary government and welfare experts to provide advice to government The senators heard that abolishing the committee will save 96000 per year and that its functions will be provided to government by the Department of Agriculture instead  In response to questions about why the government would not continue with a Labor plan to create a new Inspector General of Animal Welfare its Senate Leader Eric Abetz representing Agriculture Minister Barnaby Joyce said that the pre election announcement was no more than an election promise from Labor The hearing was told the government believes current ESCAS arrangements are sufficient and are working and that the Inspector General proposed by Labor to check the checkers represented an unnecessary level of additional red tape Topicstradefederal governmentanimal welfareruralagribusinessagricultural policylivestocksheep productionbeef cattlelivestock welfareparliament house 2600     First posted           November 19 2013 172954     Contact Anna Vidot   More stories from Australian Capital Territory

<DOC_NAME>Court hears of rise in students seeking suicide support after Geelong deaths</DOC_NAME>
<TEXT>
The Coroners Court has been told there was a dramatic increase in the number of young people seeking pastoral care after several Geelong students killed themselves in 2009  The Coroner is investigating the deaths of Zac Harvey 15 Taylor Janssen 16 and Chanelle Rae 14 who were students at different campuses of Western Heights College when they ended their lives The Coroner Judge Gray has described the deaths as tragic The regional manager of student well being at the time Liz Jones told the court a school normally counsels about 20 at risk students after a pupil takes their life but after Chanelle Raes death that number rose to 70 We certainly saw a shift to the more intensive end of the scale she said Ms Jones told the court many students were worried they might be at risk of committing suicide because it was contagious  She also told the court that after Taylor Janssens death welfare staff at the school uncovered and dealt with a suicide pact between two girls at the school  She told the court each girl had confessed plans to kill themselves if the other did and counsellors worked with the girls intensively to make sure this did not happen  Ms Jones said the school had a number of strategies in place to deal with suicide bullying and mental illness among its students  They had strong pastoral care processes she said She said extra resources were called in to respond to Chanelle Raes death in July 2009 But she said the intense media attention placed a lot of pressure on staff  She said someone wrote to the principal threatening to kill her if the bullying at the school continued  The court heard there was an increase in staff sick leave after the suicides and only one of the five senior principal staff members is still teaching in Victoria  Ms Jones said the media coverage of the deaths was problematic and described how reporters and camera crews were seen outside the front of the school  There were students arriving at school distressed because they had been approached by the media she said Some students told staff reporters had also approached them through social media She said the school struggled to manage student welfare with the constant requests from the media It was a response of unprecedented level and Id say to the limit of our programs she said The Coroner is investigating the deaths with a particular focus on the role of the media cyber bullying and the support available to students  The hearing continues  If you or someone you know needs help you can contact Lifeline on 13 11 14  Topicscommunity and societysuicidemental healthvicgeelong 3220     First posted           November 19 2013 160616       More stories from Victoria
