<TEXT>
Cricket and AFL fans have been warned not to scatter the ashes of loved ones on the Melbourne Cricket Ground The warning comes after employees found piles of ashes on the stadiums turf after a public open day at the ground The Melbourne Cricket Club strictly bans the practice and frequently rejects requests for people to scatter ashes Club spokesman Shane Brown has warned people against trying to secretly scatter remains Often you find in the ashes there are small fragments of bone that are left in the ash and that can be quite sharp and jagged and for footballers and cricketers running across the turf that can be quite dangerous he said Mr Brown says ashes that are scattered do not stay there for long The most important message for anyone who wants to do this is to understand that over time their loved ones ashes will actually be removed from the MCG and discarded into waste because we replace the turf quite regularly as part of our maintenance program he said So anyones ashes that were on the turf wont stay at the MCG which was the intention in the first place Topicsdeathcommunity and societyaustralian football leaguesportcricketmelbourne 3000vic     First posted           December 15 2013 145840       More stories from Victoria

<TEXT>
The futures of Perth Glory coach Alistair Edwards and club captain Jacob Burns are in doubt after the pair became embroiled in a bitter feud Burns was furious at his coach after being left on the bench during Friday nights 2 0 loss to Melbourne Victory The 35 year old had just returned from a two week suspension and could not understand why he was not given any game time in a team already missing a host of their best players The Glory launched crisis talks on Saturday in a bid to settle a rumoured player driven revolt against Edwards who has been accused of favouring his two sons Ryan and Cameron over other players Edwards believes the drama stemmed from a discussion he had with Burns several weeks ago when he told the former Socceroo that he might not be part of his future plans Theres definitely a rift between Jacob Burns and myself thats for sure Edwards said It stems from the fact we had a discussion a few weeks ago about his future at the club I couldnt give him any assurances about whats happening going forward Since then its been a bit testy and because he wasnt re introduced into the team after winning last week it sort of caused a bit of a problem Edwards is in the first season of a three year deal after replacing previous coach Ian Ferguson in February But with rumours rife that he has lost the trust of a host of senior players his position is under threat Burns who has been with the club since 2009 is also facing an uncertain future Edwards denied he had favoured his two sons over other players this season Striker Ryan Edwards was handed a starting role against the Victory while Cameron came off the bench When asked whether Burns would play for the Glory again Edwards was not sure Well that depends on performance and attitude going forward Edwards said We hope so The seventh placed Glory will be back in action next Sunday when they play host to Adelaide United at Perth Oval AAP Topicssoccersportperth 6000waaustralia   More stories from Western Australia

Immigration Minister Scott Morrison insists he is closely monitoring an Afghan resettlement program following reports an interpreter waiting to come to Australia was killed by the Taliban Fairfax newspapers have reported that an interpreter who worked with the Australian Army has been killed by the Taliban in an apparent revenge attack It has been reported that he was waiting for resettlement in Australia under a program designed to provide refuge to Afghans who work with Coalition forces Mr Morrison has previously announced plans to provide 800 visas to Afghan nationals and their families A spokesman said the Government would not comment on individual cases given the security risks but said the Minister has been receiving weekly updates to ensure the program delivers help to those who have risked their lives The program is being closely monitored to ensure as promised we help those and their families who have risked their lives to aid our diggers the spokesman said For operational security reasons and to protect the privacy of the LEE Locally Engaged Employees the Government does not reveal details about the way in which protection is provided The Government says the program is not just limited to interpreters According to the Fairfax reports other interpreters are mostly in hiding while they wait for their visa applications to process In October Mr Morrison announced the 800 Afghans would be accepted through Australias current annual humanitarian intake which the Coalition has cut to 13750 He said the Australian Government was not going to leave these people behind The Greens have called on the Government to speed up the issuing of protection visas for interpreters Its too dangerous for us to leave these interpreters in the hands of the Taliban immigration spokesperson Sarah Hanson Young said in a statement After they supported our troops in the war this is the least we can do We need to get on with it because in this situation delay means death Topicsdefence and national securitydefence forcesrefugeesimmigrationfederal governmentgovernment and politicsafghanistanaustralia     First posted           December 15 2013 132417

<DOC_NAME>Syrian rebel commander freezes to death as cold-snap grips the Middle East</DOC_NAME>
<TEXT>
A Syrian rebel commander has frozen to death in the bitter cold brought on by a snowstorm that has swept the country this week a monitoring group said Saturday The body of a rebel commander who was on his way from the north western province of Idlib to Homs in central Syria has been found He died during the snowstorm said the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights Observatory director Rami Abdel Rahman said there were no signs of gunshots or other wounds and that the body was frozen Syria has been struck by a severe snowstorm that has brought icy temperatures to several countries in the Levant The cold snap started on Wednesday and while by Saturday temperatures were starting to improve several areas remained completely covered in snow including Damascus battle torn Qalamoun Aleppo province and Homs People living in rebel held areas where there are fuel electricity and food shortages have been especially affected by the storm as have refugees living in tents in neighbouring countries Mr Abdel Rahman said the unnamed commander in his 40s was a member of the Islamist Suqur al Sham brigades The Britain based Observatory also reported that the frozen bodies of two men in their 30s were found in Homs province on a road to neighbouring Hama province but it could not say whether they were rebels or civilians The main opposition National Coalition reported Thursday that a baby and a child died of cold in Aleppo northern Syria and Rastan in Homs   But the icy weather has not stopped the fighting on a key front at Adra east of Damascus Battles have been raging there for four days ever since Islamist rebels launched an offensive aimed at capturing one of the main entrances to the capital The army hit back with a broad counter offensive and on Saturday a security source in Damascus told AFP that the armys operations are continuing Starting yesterday we identified the areas where the terrorists are positioned and we are attacking them President Bashar al Assads regime brands rebels and dissidents as terrorists  The source also said a savage massacre had been committed in Adra on Wednesday without specifying a toll The Observatory had reported 15 civilians killed Wednesday and Thursday On Saturday it said another 12 bodies had been found near Adra and that activists have accused the regime of killing them   As Syria struggles through the cold snap a Danish led task force is being readied in Cyprus to remove the first part of Syrias deadly chemical stockpile due before the end of this year Under a deal worked out between the United States and Russia Syria will relinquish control of deadly toxins which can be used to make sarin VX gas and other lethal agents Denmark and Norway plan to use two cargo vessels to transport the cargo out of the Syrian port city of Latakia escorted by two frigates of their respective navies and deliver it to the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons OPCW for destruction The deadliest chemicals in Syrias stockpile are due to be shipped out of the country by the end of the year under an agreement between Damascus and the OPCW but the ongoing conflict is complicating efforts to meet that deadline The timing is another matter and it is related to a lot of other uncertainties right now but we are preparing to be ready as fast as possible Commodore Torben Mikkelsen of Denmark the commander of the combined task force said My job right now is to prepare this task group capable of transporting chemical agents out of the port of Latakia in Syria to a so far not identified destination for ongoing further destruction of these chemical agents he told journalists in the Cypriot port of Limassol US defence officials said earlier this month that sea trials were planned of equipment which could neutralise the deadly chemicals on board a merchant marine ship The technology known as hydrolysis turns dangerous toxins into a low toxicity liquid waste Task force officials said a harbour was needed for the cargo to be transferred for its final destruction I think the plan is we will be heading for a harbour where we will meet an American ship and they have a field deployable hydrolysis system on board and they will destroy them at sea said Bjorn Schmidt a chemist of the Danish Emergency Management Agency who is a member of the mission The OPCW was given the task of overseeing destruction of Syrias chemical weapons stocks following a sarin gas attack on the outskirts of Damascus which killed hundreds of people last August The task force was bolstered by chemical experts and vessel protection teams Mr Schmidt said that he believed in the worst case scenario about 500 tonnes of priority 1 chemicals   those that can make sarin and VX   would be shifted out of Syria It that size of estimate is because we have the priority 1 chemicals which are those we want out But we are not aware if it is actually going to happen if they get all the packed chemicals to the harbour we dont know that yet he said Officers said the task force would go as many times as it takes to remove the toxins AFP Topicsunrest conflict and warforeign affairssyrian arab

<DOC_NAME>Iran claims second monkey sent to space and back</DOC_NAME>
<TEXT>
Iran says it has successfully sent a monkey into space for the second time as part of a program aimed at manned space flight President Hassan Rouhani says the monkey named Fargam Auspicious has returned to Earth in perfect health Mr Rouhani has congratulated the scientists involved in the mission in a message carried by Irans official IRNA news agency In January Iran said it had successfully brought a live monkey called Pishgam pioneer back to Earth from orbit  But the experiments success was disputed when a different monkey was presented to the media after the landing  An earlier attempt had failed in September 2011 By the grace of God and through the efforts of Iranian space scientists the Pajohesh research rocket containing the second live space monkey was sent into space and brought back to Earth safely Mr Rouhani said   Irans space program was heavily promoted by Mr Rouhanis controversial predecessor Mahmoud Ahmadinejad Mr Ahmadinejad said in February that he was ready to be the first Iranian to be sacrificed by the scientists of my country and go into space even though I know there are a lot of candidates To the dismay of animal welfare groups Fargam was following in the footsteps of a menagerie of dogs and monkeys who were among the early stars of the US and Soviet space programs in the 1960s  Earlier this year Iranian space officials raised the prospect of sending a Persian cat into space Irans archaic experiment is a throwback to the primitive techniques of the 1950s People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals spokesman Ben Williamson said at the time The stated aim of Irans program is a manned launch by 2020 Irans space program has prompted concern among Western governments which fear the technology could be used for ballistic missiles The UN Security Council has imposed an almost total embargo on the export of nuclear and space technology to Iran since 2007 Tehran denies its space program has any link with its alleged nuclear ambitions AFP Topicsspace explorationanimalsnuclear issuesworld politicsiran islamic republic ofasia     First posted           December 15 2013 032744
