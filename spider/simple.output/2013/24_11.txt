<TEXT>
South Africa celebrated its 10th Test win of the year and dealt France an eighth defeat in a miserable 2013 for the hosts with a 19 10 victory at the Stade de France on Sunday AEDT A quick try by JP Pietersen 11 points from the boot of Morne Steyn and a late penalty from Pat Lambie condemned an uninspired Les Bleus to their first loss to the Springboks on home soil since 1997 France went into the match looking for a change of fortune after losing three Six Nations games and suffering four consecutive defeats this year against New Zealand but were immediately on the back foot Pietersen charged down Morgan Parras kick with barely one minute on the clock to score the early try and Morne Steyn added the extras Parra missed a 30 metre penalty kick while France who beat only Scotland and Tonga in 2013 relied too much on fly half Remi Taless kicking and gave away numerous balls as they struggled to cope with the tourists aggressive defence The Springboks who whitewashed Scotland 28 0 last week after beating Wales 24 15 went 10 points up with a 38 metre penalty from Steyn while some poor offloads meant France could not play its usual inspired attacking game Steyn added three points with another penalty only for Yoann Huget to give Les Bleus a lifeline when he dived over in the corner from Parras pass for the try Parra converted the try to reduce the deficit to six points Jaque Fourie touched down early in the second half after Jean de Villiers had run through the paper thin French defence only for the try to be ruled out for knock on Huget was again the man in the 50th minute when he stuck out an arm to touch first over his line and prevent Francois Louw from scoring his teams second try Les Bleus lost touch again at the hour after Steyns third penalty earned the visitors a nine point lead just before Philippe Saint Andre added beef to his side by bringing in Mathieu Bastareaud for Florian Fritz Hopes of a late comeback took a knock in the 68th minute however when Thomas Domingo picked up a yellow card for a spear tackle on Bryan Habana Huget made a brilliant dart and caught the defence off guard with a fine kick only for the rebound to bounce just over his head as he was sprinting for a certain try Eight minutes from time Louw was also sent to the bin for punching Pascal Pape in the scrum allowing substitute scrum half Jean Marc Doussain to bring the gap down to six points with the resulting penalty Les Bleus then made yet another mistake in their own half and Lambie sealed South Africas win with a perfectly executed penalty kick one minute from time Reuters Topicsrugby unionsportfrance

<DOC_NAME>Iran nuclear program deal reached with world powers during diplomatic talks in Geneva</DOC_NAME>
<TEXT>
Iran has reached a deal with six world powers to curb its nuclear activities in return for the easing of sanctions imposed by Western countries EU foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton who coordinated the talks in Genevasaid they had agreed a first step towards a comprehensive solution United States president Barack Obama hailed the deal saying While todays announcement is just a first step it achieves a great deal For the first time in nearly a decade we have halted the progress of the Iranian nuclear program and key parts of the program will be rolled back Today that diplomacy opened up a new path toward a world that is more secure   a future in which we can verify that Irans nuclear program is peaceful and that it cannot build a nuclear weapon he said   However the White House stressed the six month deal is temporary and Iran must do much more to end the sanctions it is under and convince the world it is not seeking a nuclear bomb With respect to the comprehensive solution nothing is agreed until everything is agreed a statement said Put simply this first step expires in six months and does not represent an acceptable end state to the United States or our P51 partners it added Under the agreement Iran has promised not to enrich more uranium above a level of five per cent for six months It has also agreed to halt construction of the Arak research reactor which is feared capable of yielding potential bomb material In return the six powers will remove the embargo on trade with Iran in precious metals while refraining from imposing new sanctions for six months Chinasforeign ministerWangYisaysthe deal will help normalise relations with Iran andwill helpprovideabetterlife fortheIranianpeople Today that diplomacy opened up a new path toward a world that is more secure   a future in which we can verify that Irans nuclear program is peaceful and that it cannot build a nuclear weapon   This agreement will help to uphold the international nuclear non proliferation system and safeguard peace and stability in the Middle East Mr Wang said in a statement The historic deal came after four days of intensive negotiations between Iranian interlocutors and high ranking delegations from the US Britain France China and Russia plus Germany in the grouping known as the P51 Irans president Hassan Rouhani hailed an agreement with world powers over Tehrans nuclear drive saying it would open new horizons Constructive engagement in addition to tireless efforts by negotiating teams are to open new horizons Mr Rouhani said on Twitter Mr Rouhani said the deal had been made possible due to Iranian peoples vote for moderation referring to his surprise election victory in June The talks had hit snags over a few points of difference including Irans insistence to have what it calls its right to enrich uranium to be recognised by the six major powers US secretary of state John Kerry made it clear on Saturday local time that the landmark deal does not give Tehran a right to enrich uranium Constructive engagement in addition to tireless efforts by negotiating teams are to open new horizons   This first step does not say that Iran has the right of enrichment no matter what interpretative comments are made he told reporters His comments came shortly after Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif had said the agreement contained a clear reference that enrichment will continue Mr Kerry and foreign ministers of the five other world powers joined the talks with Iran early on Saturday as the two sides appeared to be edging closer to a long sought preliminary agreement The talks were aimed at finding a package of confidence building steps to ease decades of tensions and banish the spectre of a Middle East war over Tehrans nuclear aspirations But Israel has slammed the deal as a bad agreement with economic minister Naftali Bennett saying his country was not bound by it and had a right to self defence Israeli foreign minister Avigdor Lieberman told public radio This agreement is the greatest diplomatic victory of Iran which has gained recognition for its so called legitimate right to enrich uranium The Western powers goal had been to cap Irans nuclear energy program which has a history of evading UN inspections and investigations to remove any risk of Tehran covertly refining uranium to a level suitable for bombs Tehran denies it would ever weaponise enrichment Refined uranium can be used to fuel nuclear power plants   Irans stated goal   but also provide the fissile core of an atomic bomb if refined much further Diplomacy was stepped up after the landslide election of Hassan Rouhani a relative moderate as Iranian president in June replacing bellicose nationalist Mahmoud Ahmadinejad Mr Rouhani aims to mend fences with big powers and get sanctions lifted He obtained crucial public backing from supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei keeping powerful hardline critics at bay   ABCwires Topicsnuclear
