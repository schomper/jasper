<DOC_NAME>Israel Folau wants Wallabies to maintain psychological edge over Wales</DOC_NAME>
<TEXT>
Israel Folau said Australia would look to extend its psychological edge over Wales when the 2015 World Cup pool rivals meet in Cardiff this weekend The Wallabies head into Sunday mornings AEDT match at the Millennium Stadium on a run of eight straight wins over Wales And if they needed more incentive it is provided by the fact Wales starting line up contains 11 members of the victorious British and Irish Lions squad that won a three match series 2 1 in Australia earlier this year There is still a bit of spice in it especially after the Lions Folau said A lot of the Welsh boys were involved in that series and its still clear in our minds It is going to be a big contest the full back said Folaus impressive debut season in international rugby union has left him on the verge of breaking team mate Quade Coopers Australian record of nine Test tries in a calendar year The World Cup was a big draw in me coming to union added Folau who played league for the Melbourne Storm and Brisbane Broncos before joining AFL side Greater Western Sydney Its in the back of my mind if I play well Wallabies coach Ewen McKenzie is doing a great job bringing the boys together as a team and hopefully at the World Cup we can be a strong force We look at how teams like Wales and Ireland are playing now so I imagine in a couple of years they will be strong forces Hopefully we will be as well If we can win this week we can have a bit of a psychological edge over Wales Weve done a job on them in the past and we hope to do another on Saturday Folau still only 24 years old believes his multi sport background has made him a better union player I started off playing league for four years but made a bit of a right hand turn in 2010 to take up Australian Rules for a couple of years That was different Then the opportunity came up to play rugby union I wasnt expecting it but Im glad it did It has been a great year and Ive really enjoyed it Australian Rules was very different I hadnt any experience playing Rules but I thought I would give it a crack Different skills are used but it has helped me a lot in my transition to union You have always got to be positioned correctly in rugby Also kicking and catching the high ball was a big thing in Rules so playing it sharpened my skills For me playing at full back most of my time is spent reading the game and being in the right spot at the right time Being two or three metres off makes a heck of a difference I am slowly getting there working on different combinations with Quade Cooper and building an understanding Quade is a great player and does a lot of unexpected things that other players cannot do You have to react to what he does You might think hes going to do one thing but he does something completely different I am lucky to have that league background and it has helped me a lot in terms of reaction and instinct AFP Topicsrugby unionsportwalesaustralia     First posted           November 30 2013 075539
