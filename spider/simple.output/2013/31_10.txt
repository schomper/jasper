The Sheffield Shield needs answer sagging interest rather simply playing lights inject competition help rivals across Tasman writes Adam Collins To die hard cricket lovers Sheffield Shield pure game gets A truly elite first class competition sits proudly atop cricketing world best kind Yet Shield long reduced blip mainstream sporting radar despite proving ground Australian XI beloved national sporting team As I write Im watching Victorias opening day season MCG There probably people sitting Members luncheon entire sparse stadium The MCG never meant lonely Of course competition principally played working week attendances arent great barometer And Im sure tens thousands who like me procrastinate work summer months following scores corner computer screen In case matter choose measure it Shield cricket less insider competition obvious prospect achieving broad national appeal outside entrenched cricket circles We shouldnt lose much sleep this Sure itd great coming tens thousands case 50 years ago I one grateful have So isnt sob story Rather I see lack broad interest Shield cricket asset would protests current Shield structure shaken bit good game engineering boost interest along way Theres magic bullet drag people gates bit creativity doubt product strong enough get back TV least Naturally theres grab bag ideas could looked at original others daynight fixtures compulsory closure first or indeed second innings taking games permanently big stadiums suburbs regions name few One idea hasnt explored least canvassed broadly moving away traditional six team competition endured since Tasmania joined mainland states late 1970s Almost every Australian domestic sporting competition realised potential embracing Kiwi comrades bolstering ranks Admitting couple New Zealand sides Shield   purpose hypothetical lets say one North South Island   could yield substantial benefits parties For Australian cricket development would give young Aussies chance play wider range international standard players Granted may negligible benefit Shield already brimming international quality players hard identify downside throwing more Important also would expose young players broader range conditions away games across Tasman Administrators could anticipate increase public interest revamped expanded Shield would see heavy lifting attracting people domestic game rather outsourcing task almost exclusively Big Bash tournament Not mention Trans Tasman commercial opportunities partially offset significant financial investment put competition Cricket Australia For New Zealand cricket potential upside dramatic Theirs sad decline longer form game last quarter century The cop response population impedes success rely freakish superstars buck trend As Australians know crass equation rubbish If performance international sporting arena   cricket otherwise   reflected relative population really would riots street But I digress Giving New Zealands best cricketers chance compete premier domestic first class competition world result better results national team Surely cricket lovers first foremost agree would good strength Test cricket whole Especially place cricketing landscape constant pervasive threat see cricket red ball merely obstruction T20 pay days Great care would need put developing draw didnt expand already packed calendar remaining fair This accounted two groups four playing teams group twice each group once This equals magic number ten games apiece   status quo   winners two groups making final Naturally one example list logistical challenges would need overcome But its hard imagine hurdle New Zealand administrators couldnt overcome incentive place It need spell death domestic competition either could scaled back modest fixture
