<DOC_NAME>MYEFO expected to reveal $120 billion budget deficit over forward estimates</DOC_NAME>
<TEXT>
Prime Minister Tony Abbott has warned the Government will have to introduce serious policy change to break a decade run of deficits Todays Mid Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook MYEFO is expected to unveil combined deficits worth more than 120 billion over the four years of the forward estimates The Government says that if left unchecked the current economic settings will spur deficit budgets for the next 10 years Mr Abbott says the figures released today will trigger an acceleration of the Coalitions budget repair job Obviously it accelerates from today given that today we will see the full extent of Labors debt and deficit disaster he said   What we will see today is the sad truth that six years of Labor fiscal profligacy has given us cumulative deficits in the order of a quarter of a trillion dollars That has set us up   absent serious policy change   for a decade of deficits that must and will change under the Coalition A spokesman for the Prime Minister says the quarter of a trillion dollars figure referred to the deficits posted by Labor while in Government from the 2008 09 budget through to last May MYEFO will be the Governments first major economic statement coming three months since the Coalition was elected The ABC has been told it will show a deficit of close to 50 billion this financial year   a significant increase from the 30 billion forecast during the election campaign   and more than 120 billion worth of deficits over the forward estimates The figures put an end to the Coalitions election promise to deliver a first term surplus and its revised commitment pushing that back to the first year of a second term Coalition government   It says Labors promise to limit spending growth to 2 per cent was abandoned with todays figures expected to show that in the five years to 2012 13 growth in government spending increased to 35 per cent Opposition Leader Bill Shorten says the spending was justified by the global financial crisis that hit in 2008 Theres no doubt that Australia when through the toughest set of peace time economic circumstances with the global financial crisis he told AM And that because of Labor we still managed to keep unemployment relatively low compared to most of the modern world Despite the blowout in the budgetary position the update is not anticipated to show any major spending cuts although some reprioritisation of education spending is expected to cover the extra 12 billion for school funding It is understood trade training centres set up by the former Labor government could be cut Mr Abbott promised that the mini budget would show how he would pay for the extra funding for schools when the Government decided not to scrap the Gonski funding agreements with states and territories But the MYEFO statement is seen as being used by the Government to prepare the ground for major cuts in the May budget They will be guided by the Commission of Audit which will report early next year on potential savings through all areas of Government spending It will hand its first report to the Government at the end of January with its full findings due in March ahead of the Coalitions first budget in May The Government says one of the reasons for the increased deficit is an extra 1 billion needed to process asylum seekers offshore A 9 billion grant to the Reserve Bank announced by Mr Hockey in October has also contributed Bank of America Merrill Lynch economist Saul Eslake says the Government has a sizeable economic challenge Although growth is still positive its well below its trend pace he said The unemployment rate is rising the terms of trade will gradually decline over the balance of the decade Hence the Government has to be careful to ensure whatever it does do about the fiscal position doesnt significantly weaken the economy further Mr Shorten says the Government should cut its own wasteful spending rather than blame Labor This shows that Tony Abbotts baby bonus scheme for multi millionaires is a 22 billion white elephant It shows that giving the Reserve Bank 10 billion was a silly idea he said The Abbott Government are in charge They are paid to do their day job which is run Australia Mr Shorten has singled out the Prime Ministers signature paid parental leave scheme which he described as a joke Australia cant afford Under the scheme mothers earning up to 150000 a year will be paid their full wage including superannuation for 26 weeks The Abbott Governments got to stop fighting the last election and get on with governing the country Mr Shorten said They should be honest enough to admit that the 22 billion paid parental leave scheme is a joke and Australia cant afford it Labors final budget update released just before the election was called outlined a 30 billion deficit for 2013 14 and massive revenue write downs     Topicsfederal governmentgovernment and politicsbudgetaustralia     First posted           December 17 2013 010305

<DOC_NAME>Study dismisses disharmony as a concern for remote workers</DOC_NAME>
<TEXT>
A study examining fly in fly out FIFO and drive in drive out DIDO work arrangements has found the rostering system has no negative impacts on families Doctoral researcher Abby Chapman has surveyed about 180 female partners of FIFO and DIDO workers She has found the time away from the family did not create disharmony But she says the levels of support and communication for partners at home did have an impact Ms Chapman says these problems could be easily addressed I think finding that its not necessarily the cycle its more that support seems like an area that organisations can definitely look into to develop strategies to help families work through the time away she said   She says the number of days at work is not a concern We actually did look at that so we looked at the number of days they were at home the number of days they were at work and the time away proportion and that actually didnt have an impact she said  It wasnt the cycle at all What we found was it was purely the support systems communication social aspects of employment and then social support like counselling Topicsworkmining industrymining ruralfamilywomengladstone 4680mackay 4740rockhampton 4700toowoomba 4350townsville 4810mount isa 4825   More stories from Queensland
