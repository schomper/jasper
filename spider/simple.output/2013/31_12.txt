<DOC_NAME>Jahi McMath: brain-dead US girl ordered to be kept on ventilator for week longer</DOC_NAME>
<TEXT>
The family of a California girl who was declared brain dead after complications from a tonsillectomy has won an 11th hour court order requiring doctors to keep her connected to a breathing machine for at least another week Under the latest court order in the case doctors at the Childrens Hospital and Research Centre in Oakland are barred from taking 13 year old Jahi McMath off a ventilator without her familys consent before January 7 The extension gives the girls relatives who refuse to accept that she is beyond recovery more time to complete arrangements to have her transferred to an extended care facility But Alameda County superior court judge Evilio Grillos decision to extend the previous deadline set in his own restraining order of last week was intended to allow time for appellate review of the case hospital officials said This is a tragedy that has been postponed for another week hospital spokesman Sam Singer said A person declared brain dead is considered legally and physiologically dead under California law as is the case in many US states and the hospitals own statements about Jahi have referred to her as deceased Mr Grillo acted as the family filed a lawsuit in the US district court asking a federal judge to intervene to keep Jahi connected to the machine that has kept her heart and lungs going for more than two weeks The lawsuit claimed the hospitals planned removal of cardiopulmonary support over the objections of the girls mother and against her religious principles amounts to an infringement of religious freedom and privacy rights under the constitution Mr Grillo initially refused last week to extend his restraining order after two paediatric neurologists testified that Jahi had suffered an irreversible loss of all brain activity and was thus medically dead Family members said they were seeking to have her moved to a licensed long term treatment centre in New York and had raised US20000 in donations needed to pay for a cross country airlift Jahis grandmother Sandra Chatman herself a registered nurse said the girl had started to move her legs and appeared to be responding to voices of loved ones around her   The girls uncle Omar Sealey also said Jahi was responding to her mothers voice and touch and that he had video to prove it  We have a paediatrician who has seen Jahi who has sworn that she is not dead Mr Sealey said Hospital spokeswoman Melinda Krigel said it was not uncommon for spontaneous twitching or other body movements caused by spinal reflexes to occur in recently deceased individuals The hospital has said it would not stand in the way of Jahi being moved to another facility  But officials there also refused last week to perform additional procedures that might be required such as placing a tracheotomy and gastric tubes in her body before a transfer As part of its latest request for federal court action the family asked that the hospital be required to carry out those preparations  The hospital also has said it needed written assurances from a coroner that the transfer would be permitted Jahi was admitted to hospital on December 9 for surgery to remove her tonsils as a means of treating her sleep apnea  Shortly after the procedure she began to bleed severely suffered a heart attack and then brain swelling according to the familys lawyer Christopher Dolan Hospital officials declared her brain dead on December 12 According to medical experts Jahis lungs and heart are only continuing to function because of air being forced in and out of her body by the ventilator without which her breathing and heartbeat would cease  Unlike an individual in a coma or a vegetative state Jahi lacks any brain activity whatsoever rendering her unable to breathe on her own doctors said Hospital officials have said the facility and state health officials are investigating how a routine operation led to Jahis death and that they understand the familys anguish We have the deepest sympathy for Jahis mother who wishes her daughter was alive but the ventilator cannot reverse the brain death that has occurred and it would be wrong to give false hope that Jahi will ever come back to life Dr David Durand the chief of paediatrics said in a statement  Reuters Topicshuman interestmedical proceduresmedical ethicsdoctors and medical professionalslaw crime and justiceunited states

<DOC_NAME>WikiLeaks under fire after delegation travels to Syria to meet Bashar al-Assad</DOC_NAME>
<TEXT>
The Federal Opposition has accused the WikiLeaks Party of irresponsibility after some of its members travelled to Syria to meet with the countrys president Bashar al Assad The Syrian president released a Twitter photo on December 23 which appeared to show the meeting The delegation reportedly included WikiLeaks founder Julian Assanges father John Shipton who is currently the WikiLeaks Party chairman In a statement posted on the Wikileaks Party website in the lead up to the meeting a spokesman said the purpose of the trip was to show solidarity with the Syrian people and to voice opposition to Western military intervention While the WikiLeaks Party recognises the needs for political reforms in Syria and to fight against corruption and abuses of human rights it does not support achieving this by violence Western military intervention and destruction of the country the statement said Due to security concerns and because of the high levels of violence in Syria we cannot give detailed information about the delegation Labor frontbencher Chris Bowen says sending a delegation to Syria was not appropriate That is an extraordinary thing for them to do he said It underlines their irresponsible approach The Assad regime has been widely criticised and correctly criticised around the world And for an Australian political party to think its sensible to go and have discussions and try and provide some legitimacy is something I think which they have to explain The ABC has contacted the WikiLeaks Party for a response   The visit came as Syrian forces were accused of killing civilians in a series of barrel bomb air strikes in the northern city of Aleppo Opposition activists said regime helicopters dropped barrels full of explosives on a vegetable market and next to a hospital in the city which has become a key battleground in the countrys two year civil war which has so far killed more than 100000 people On Monday disarmament teams returned Scandinavian escort vessels to port in Cyprus after they accepted that an end of year deadline for the removal of Syrian chemical weapons could no longer be met The Norwegian frigate Helge Ingstad was ordered back to port along with a Danish warship that had been deployed to escort the dangerous cargo to destruction under international supervision Norwegian spokesman Lars Hovtun said He gave no new date for the planned shipment We are still on high alert to go into Syria he said We still dont know exactly when the orders will come The international disarmament mission in Syria acknowledged on Saturday that it was unlikely the weapons could be transported to the Syrian port of Latakia in time for the December 31 deadline set for the removal of key weapons components The year end deadline was the first key milestone under a UN Security Council backed deal arranged by Russia and the United States that aims to wipe out all of Syrias chemical arms by the middle of 2014 Preparations continue in readiness for the transport of most of the critical chemical material from the Syrian Arab Republic for outside destruction said a joint statement from the UN and Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons However at this stage transportation of the most critical chemical material before 31 December is unlikely ABCAFP   Topicsunrest conflict and warworld politicsterrorismactivism and lobbyingsyrian arab republicaustralia     First posted           December 31 2013 135744
