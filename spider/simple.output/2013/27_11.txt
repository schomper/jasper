<DOC_NAME>No decision yet on replacing Vines Creek bridges</DOC_NAME>
<TEXT>
The Queensland Transport Minister says it is too early to say when and if the State Government will replace two key bridges in Mackay Scott Emerson was in the city yesterday to inspect the Vines Creek bridges on Harbour Road which have been reduced to one lane each way due to concerns about the integrity of the pylons He announced 800000 for detailed design work but stopped short of committing to build the bridges Mr Emerson says it could be years before the bridges are replaced Look it will take up to 12 months to do the design work so Im not saying its going to happen quickly but the important thing is that we are getting on with the job he said What weve done is made sure this bridge remains open If we had done what Labor did the bridge would be closed We appreciate that we need to solve this problem so the first task it to get the design work done That will then tell us how much it will cost to fix the bridge and then well go onto that So theres obviously a number of ways to fund that but the first job is to ensure that weve got the design work so we know exactly what it will cost and what is required Mackay Mayor Deirdre Comerfod met Mr Emerson yesterday and says she again highlighted how critical the bridges are to the city She says she also sought a number of assurances from the Minister I wanted to know that the bridges would be safe and theyve ensured that she said Imagine if those bridges were out of action just imagine how far people would have to travel out of their way to get to that part of the world so thats not a good outcome So theyre committed to keeping those bridges operational until they can replace them Topicsurban development and planningstates and territoriesmackay 4740   More stories from Queensland
