<DOC_NAME>Review recommends ACTEW water, energy services be split</DOC_NAME>
<TEXT>
A review of Canberra utility provider ACTEW suggests the corporations water and energy services be separated Dr Bruce Cohen was commissioned by the ACT Government to review ACTEWs governance arrangements after it was revealed that the salary of managing director Mark Sullivan was under reported by almost 235000 Dr Cohens report offers 22 recommendations including that ACTEW take responsibility for all water services in the Territory including stormwater He also suggests ACTEWs interest in joint venture energy supplier ActewAGL be split off into a separate entity Treasurer Andrew Barr says that option has been suggested many times before I dont think inevitable is the word Id use but it is something that does need active consideration he said Weve certainly got a thorough report that provides a wide range of recommendations that Government needs to consider Separating the corporations responsibilities would leave the way open for the electricity and gas business to be privatised in the future ACTEW acting chair Michael Easson says the review is an excellent introduction to the challenges and future directions for water regulation and governance in the Territory  Dr Cohen clearly sees that ACTEW operates well He was at pains to say there is no crisis or pressing problem needing an urgent remedy he said But after ACTEW took back water operations and after 13 years of one of the most successful private public partnerships in the country with ActewAGL it is time to consider structure and operations afresh  All organisations need to seek continual improvement and demand of themselves and their people to do better Canberra Liberals spokesman Brendan Smyth says the report highlights the importance of ACTEW addressing its rising debt levels It can not continue to simply have debt without any strategy to repay that debt he said We all know from our own households you cant borrow on the house and not pay it off What this Government does is make ACTEW borrow but continues to take their dividend without any strategy to repay the debt The Government says it will respond to the review next year Topicsstates and territorieswater managementactcanberra 2600     First posted           December 20 2013 150304       More stories from Australian Capital Territory
