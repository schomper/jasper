<DOC_NAME>Newly released documents leaked by Edward Snowden reveal extent of US, British spying</DOC_NAME>
<TEXT>
Newly released documents have revealed more targets of British and American intelligence agencies including a senior European Union official Israeli government offices foreign companies and aid organisations The Guardian New York Times and Der Spiegel have published details of documents leaked by the fugitive US intelligence contractor Edward Snowden which show that the agencies   the US National Security Agency NSA and its British counterpart GCHQ   had a long list of surveillance targets The reported extent of the surveillance has upset many US allies and fuelled a heated debate about the balance between privacy and security as Snowden remains living in Russia under temporary asylum The newspapers reported that in January 2009 GCHQ and the NSA had targeted an email address listed as belonging to the Israeli prime minister who at the time was Ehud Olmert Spies also monitored email traffic between then Israeli defence minister Ehud Barak and his chief of staff Yoni Koren the newspapers said Other targets were said to include the United Nations Childrens Fund French aid organisation Medecins du Monde French oil and gas firm Total and French defence company Thales Group Joaquin Almunia the European competition commissioner who oversees anti monopoly investigations and has been involved in a long running case involving Google was another to appear in GCHQ documents although it was not clear who ordered the surveillance The European Commission said if the claims were true they would deserve the strongest condemnation This is not the type of behaviour that we expect from strategic partners let alone from our own member states a spokesman said The NSA denies carrying out spying activities aimed at benefitting US businesses We do not use our foreign intelligence capabilities to steal the trade secrets of foreign companies on behalf of   or give intelligence we collect to   US companies to enhance their international competitiveness or increase their bottom line a spokeswoman said The intelligence communitys efforts to understand economic systems and policies and monitor anomalous economic activities are critical to providing policy makers with the information they need to make informed decisions that are in the best interest of our national security GCHQ said only that it operated under a strong system of checks and balances Meanwhile US president Barack Obama has given a press conference at the White House where he said some checks were needed on his governments surveillance system Mr Obama said he would spend the next few weeks sorting through the recommendations of a presidential advisory panel on how to rein in the NSA in the wake of Snowdens disclosures He said it is possible that some bulk phone data collected by intelligence agencies could be kept by private companies instead of the US government as a way of restoring Americans trust in the program Mr Obama said the US could not unilaterally disarm but information could be collected with more checks and balances The president also refused to be drawn on the possibility of amnesty or a presidential pardon for Snowden who has been indicted on espionage charges As important and as necessary as this debate has been it is also important to keep in mind that this has done unnecessary damage to US intelligence capabilities and US diplomacy he said ABCwires Topicsdefence and national securitysecurity intelligencecomputers and technologyunited statesunited kingdomeuropean unionisraelfrance

<DOC_NAME>Sixers win Big Bash League battle of Sydney, beating the Thunder by six wickets</DOC_NAME>
<TEXT>
The Sydney Thunders Big Bash misery continued into a third season despite a David Warner cameo on Saturday night   Warner released from the Test squad for the opening BBL round smashed 50 from 31 balls as he easily transferred the form which has dominated England into crickets shortest format But it was a wasted effort as the Thunders winless streak was extended into a new year The Sixers continued their cross city dominance by chasing down the target of 167 with six wickets and 10 balls to spare in front of 18180 fans The Thunder have collected back to back wooden spoons and have not won a match since December 23 2011 while the Sixers remain unbeaten against their western Sydney rivals Warner who struck a match winning century in his only previous appearance for the Thunder did his best to change that The leading Ashes scorer this summer with 457 runs at 914 took little time settling into the Twenty20 format   spanking three boundaries from the first five balls he faced He and Usman Khawaja 66 off 51 put on 116 for the opening Thunder wicket but were given next to no support as high profile teammates Mike Hussey 2 and Eoin Morgan 4 failed to deliver The final nine Thunder overs delivered just 50 runs as they posted 166 still a record for the franchise But it never looked enough as Nic Maddinson put on a Warner esque show of his own pounding 61 off 40 balls Maddinson displayed all of the strokeplay that earned him an international T20 debut against India in October hitting six boundaries and four sixes One of those sixes was a sublime flick off the hip that sailed into the second tier of the Members Pavilion   and came one delivery after being struck on the chin by a Gurinder Sandhu bouncer His cavalier knock ended when caught by the man of the moment Warner for 61 But efforts from skipper Steve Smith 22 Ravi Bopara 27 off 17 and Moises Henriques 28 off 18 steered them home Sydney Thunder 6 for 166 Khawaja 66 Warner 50 Henriques 2 for 24 Cosgrove 1 for 10 def by Sydney Sixers 4 for 167 Maddinson 61 Henriques 28 not out Sandri 1 for 20 Sandhu 1 for 25 Topicscricketsportsydney 2000nswaustralia     First posted           December 21 2013 224316       More stories from New South Wales
