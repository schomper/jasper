<DOC_NAME>East China Sea row escalates, as Wang Yi tells Julia Bishop that Australia has 'jeopardised trust'</DOC_NAME>
<TEXT>
The Chinese foreign minister has launched an unprecedented public attack on the Australian Government accusing it of jeopardising bilateral mutual trust as the row over the East China Sea escalates The two countries are at odds over Chinas move to declare an air defence zone which requires aircraft to provide their flight plans and declare their nationalities or face defensive emergency measures Australian Foreign Minister Julie Bishop last weeksummoned Beijings ambassadorto voice opposition to the zone which in part covers an area also claimed by Japan Ms Bishop said the timing and the manner of Chinas announcement was unhelpful and would not contribute to regional stability But China reacted angrily to Ms Bishops comments labelling them irresponsible and mistaken   And now in a dramatic departure from what are normally scripted meetings Chinas foreign minister Wang Yi has hit out at Ms Bishop in face to face talks I have to point out that what Australia has said and done with regard to Chinas establishment of the air defence identification zone in the East China Sea has jeopardised bilateral mutual trust and affected the sound growth of bilateral relations he said To speak like that in front of reporters who are only allowed in for the first few minutes of a meeting was a deliberate slap down from the government of president Xi Jinping Mr Wang also said the general public in China are deeply dissatisfied with Australias comments Across the entire Chinese society and the general public are deeply dissatisfied with that and this is not what we desire to see he said Ms Bishop in turn told Mr Wang that Australia respects Chinas right to speak out on issues She said she hoped China will respect Australias right to speak out on actions that affect a region of critical security importance to Australia The move by China has also fuelled tensions with Japan because the zone covers Tokyo controlled islands   known as Senkaku in Japan and Diaoyu in China   where ships and aircraft from the two countries already shadow each other in a potentially dangerous confrontation We take no position on the Diaoyu Islands in the East China Sea but we take decisions in our national interest Ms Bishop said We urge that there be no unilateral actions nor coercive actions but that both sides act in accordance with international law She winds up her visit to China later today Topicsinternational aid and tradegovernment and politicsdefence and national securitydefence and aerospace industrieschinaaustraliajapan     First posted           December 07 2013 080545
