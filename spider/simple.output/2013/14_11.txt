<TEXT>
Sixteen year old schoolboy Jake Doran will get a shot at England later this month after being picked in a Chairmans XI side to face the tourists in a two day match in Alice Springs England has already complained about the standard of opposition being tossed up to them so far on tour but has failed to fully assert itself against less fancied opposition But the tourists will be eager to ensure a schoolboy from Fairfield in Sydneys west does not ride roughshod over them before they head to Adelaide for the second Test Sheffield Shield fixtures will be largely unaffected by the Chairmans XI clash with a largely developmental side selected for the tour match sitting in between the first and second Tests in the heat of the red centre Former Test spinner Michael Beer will captain the side with Doran the only player without senior state experience Doran is a left handed batsman for the Australian Under 19s side that will compete in next years under 19s World Cup in Dubai and is being blooded against the English with an eye to the future He is a highly promising top order batsman from New South Wales who has represented the state at under 17s and 19s level This is an exciting squad England has been one of the most successful international teams in recent years and the Chairmans XI team contains some of the most exciting young cricketers in the country said Cricket Australia national talent manager Greg Chappell Kane Richardson and Luke Robins are both products of the very successful youth development program in the Northern Territory while Josh Lalor is one of two Indigenous cricketers on state contract lists with Daniel Christian being the other This will be a great leadership opportunity for captain Michael Beer who made his Test debut for Australia at the previous home Ashes series in 2011 and at age 29 still has a lot to offer This is a great opportunity to bring elite cricket to Alice Springs Tasmanian left hander Steve Cazzulino will open the batting while Ashton Turner will continue his progression after getting a start in a tour match on the Ashes tour of the UK The match starts on November 29 at Traeger Park Chairmans XI Michael Beer c Steve Cazzulino Jake Doran Marcus Harris Michael Hill Alexander Keath Josh Lalor Alister McDermott James Muirhead Kane Richardson Luke Robins Ashton Turner AAP Topicsashescricketsportalice springs 0870ntaustraliaengland   More stories from Northern Territory
