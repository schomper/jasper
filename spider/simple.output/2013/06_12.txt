<DOC_NAME>Australian Food and Grocery Council accused of backing away from agreed scheme over food labelling</DOC_NAME>
<TEXT>
The Australian Food and Grocery Council AFGC says it remains committed to a front of pack labelling scheme despite allegations it is trying to back away from a system agreed to earlier this year  Health and consumer groups have accused the AFGC of undermining the agreement to put a star rating on the label of foods and drinks  The system was agreed to by the former Labor government industry and health groups after two years of negotiations and is designed to help consumers make healthy choices  It gives food and drink products a rating out of five stars calculated by an algorithm assessing various factors  Other countries such as the UK are phasing in a traffic light labelling system that rates products on how often they should be consumed but that system was rejected by the AFGC  Australias five star system is supposed to be phased in over two years but adjustments are still being made to the algorithm designed to assess products  Jane Martin from the Obesity Policy Coalition says the AFGC is backing away from the agreement  It has been developed with industry at the table and a number of concessions have been made by public health and consumer groups she said  Initially we wanted traffic lights and industry wanted to stay with their DIG Daily Intake Guide but they have developed a new scheme Its been tested with consumers and we believe that it would help people make healthy choices Thats what were trying to do I think the processed foods industry is concerned that it will in fact drive people to healthier choices Thats all I can think and that maybe the very effectiveness of a scheme like this is proving to be its downfall The AFGC estimates the labelling change will cost the industry more than 200 million to implement  A spokesman for the AFGC says the organisation is allowed to have concerns about the existing program but that does not mean it is walking away from the agreement  He says the organisation remains committed to implementing a scheme that is attractive to industry and meaningful to consumers  The organisation is calling for a Regulator Impact Statement to be conducted  I think the processed foods industry is concerned that it will in fact drive people to healthier choices   The spokesman says there are concerns about the scheme thats been agreed to   State and territory food ministers are meeting in Melbourne next Friday chaired by Nationals Senator Fiona Nash  They are expected to discuss front of pack labelling at the meeting  Senator Nashs office would not comment on the labelling issue  Alan Kirkland the chief executive of consumer group Choice says there is evidence the AFGC is backing away from the agreement  Were seeing an alarming growth in public statements and also things being said in meetings that show the food industry being led by the AFGC is seeking to undermine the system that weve been working on for two years he said In particular theyre fighting to retain the daily intake guide that appears on a lot of food at the moment and if we have that there it will completely undermine all the work that weve done  The daily intake guide is at best misleading and at worst dangerous because it suggests that theres a percentage of things like fat and sugar and salt that you should be aiming for each day but the best nutritional advice is that you should try and minimise those There is nobody in Australia who is salt deficient so we shouldnt be encouraging people to eat more which is really what that guide does Do you know more Contact investigationsabcnetau Topicshealthdiet and nutritionfood and beveragefood and cookingindustryaustralia     First posted           December 06 2013 012517
