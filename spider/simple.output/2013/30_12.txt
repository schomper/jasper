Skipper Michael Clarke says Ryan Harris and Shane Watson will play if they are fit and available as Australia pursues a 5 0 series whitewash against England in Sydney Paceman Harris and all rounder Watson are in some doubt to play in this weeks final Ashes Test after featuring in Australias eight wicket victory over the tourists in Melbourne on Sunday Harris has general wear and tear from bowling in four consecutive Tests over the last five weeks while Watson injured a groin muscle while bowling in Englands first innings in Melbourne Clarke said the pair would be assessed by the teams medical staff to check on their availability for the Sydney Test starting Friday but they would play if fit I am not sure about Watto Watson being able to bowl in Sydney We have some extra time and that will considerably help him Clarke told reporters If Ryan Harris is fit to play I dont see any reason why the selectors wont pick him but that will be up to the medical staff and the selectors and Watto will be the same If theyre both fit I certainly want them playing If you are 100 percent able to perform at your best then I dont see any reason why you shouldnt be selected   Clarke said he did not countenance any thoughts of resting Harris for the final Test ahead of Australias tour of South Africa in March I want to win this next Test match As Ive said since taking over the captaincy if you are 100 percent able to perform at your best then I dont see any reason why you shouldnt be selected he said The Sydney Test match is no different to this Melbourne Test match our goal is now to definitely win the next Test match and hopefully the selectors will pick the best team available to play Coach Darren Lehmann said Harris was a question mark for Sydney at this stage I would say he is doubtful but until we see the medical staff and see how he recovers    the extra day gives us five day turnaround    but we will have to wait and see Its everything with him He is a valuable bowler so we wont take any risks But if he is fit and can get through and do a job for his captain he will play Lehmann said there was a possibility of playing two spinners on the normally spin friendly SCG pitch and number six batsman George Bailey needed to score runs with just 136 in six innings in this series Well have to speak to the SCG curator see what hes going to prepare You dont know about the weather whats going on he said Well have to sit down as a selection panel tonight and tomorrow morning and come up with some solutions for that Its two spinners a possibility But until we get some better info I dont know which way well go George needs to make some runs like a lot of other players The simple fact is our first innings batting hasnt been good enough Even in Adelaide it was Clarke and Brad Haddin who got that big partnership AFP Topicsashescricketsportsydney 2000nswaustralia     First posted           December 30 2013 084302       More stories from New South Wales

<DOC_NAME>SA Opposition promises to fund $50,000 bid to host World Water Ski Championships along Torrens Lake</DOC_NAME>
<TEXT>
A South Australian Opposition promise to fund a bid to host the World Water Ski Championships has made political waves with the Government saying the announcement has not been properly thought through A local committee wants to host the event along the Torrens Lake in 2017 but needs to lodge 50000 US with its official bid Opposition Leader Steven Marshall has committed to providing the funds if his party wins the March election but the Government says he has overlooked the estimated 400000 cost of hosting the event Mr Marshall says the 50000 would be refunded if the bid is unsuccessful The sports governing body has already visited and is impressed with Adelaides riverfront precinct and Mr Marshall says hosting the event would attract global exposure for the state The Torrens is a perfect setting Its already been looked at by the international organisation They say its fantastic so approximate to accommodation so approximate to the international airport he said Its an idyllic location so we would love to see the World Championships held right here in South Australia This is an event which will definitely attract not only interstate but international visitors to Australia and of course have a television audience in excess of 300 million so in terms of a return on investment this is an extraordinarily good return The technical director of the local bidding group Andy Hill says benefits to the state would far outweigh the costs Weve actually got a jump ramp in the city already from the last Australian Championships that we ran so wed only have to put that into the lake and we have to put in a slalom course which is just a number of buoys at a set distance and then just launch a boat in he said Acting Premier John Rau says the Oppositions proposal is premature What puzzles me is that Mr Marshall is of the view that this event is only 50000 he said That is only the tip of iceberg Im advised that if we were to be successful in getting the event the additional cost to Government would be an additional 300 400000 If he doesnt know that and thats going to be 400000 coming out of the budget in a few years time I wonder what other things he doesnt know are coming out of the budget   But Mr Rau conceded the Government is quietly working away on this very event There are negotiations being undertaken at the present time he said More than 40 nations and about 200 competitors take part in the championships every two years Topicswater skiingstates and territoriessaadelaide 5000     First posted           December 30 2013 090551       More stories from South Australia

<DOC_NAME>Rec boat users targeted for new on-the-spot fines</DOC_NAME>
<TEXT>
The NT Transport Department has moved closer to introducing on the spot fines for recreational boat users At the moment those who commit common marine safety offences can only be dealt with through the courts  Amateur Fishermens Association of the NT executive officer Craig Ingram said water police didnt often take it that far unless it was serious  To take small infringements to court takes a lot of police man power and time  its just not worth the effort Mr Ingram said The Transport Department has put out a discussion paper on its review of recreational vessel regulations  Its proposing to introduce an infringement notice scheme  The fines would range up to 564 for offences such as speeding near a swimmer or failing to carry proper safety equipment  The departments discussion paper says a steady increase in the number of vessels in NT waterways has resulted in an increase in the number of incidents as well as a concern for public safety Many areas of non compliance detected by water police are minor in nature and could simply be dealt with by way of issuing a MIN marine infringement notice  rather than persons being summonsed to appear in court the paper said AFANT supports on the spot fines for recreational boat users  even though it expects some Territory fishos will resist the move But Mr Ingram said an infringement notice system must be complemented by an education campaign so people knew what they needed to do You cant say no to everything Mr Ingram said Particularly when theres been a number of incidents recently where you know weve had some ah police are spending time out there on the water rescuing people who really havent been prepared and dont have the appropriate safety equipment and they believe that an EPIRB is a reasonable fall back measure for not carrying enough fuel You know Wrong The discussion paper includes Territory police statistics showing there was a total of 26018 interactions between police and vessel users both recreational and commercial in a four year period In that period police issued 748 cautions to recreational boat users Of these 428 were for serious offences and an additional 12 related to an incident where an injury occurred the paper said Anecdotally police estimate 85 percent of offenders on Territory waters are recreational vessel users The discussion paper also includes a number of other proposed changes including tweaking safety standards and simplifying water categories Public submissions on proposed changes close February 7 Topicsillegal fishinggovernment and politicsspeed boatsnt     First posted           December 30 2013 110734       More stories from Northern Territory
