<DOC_NAME>New Zealand hungry for Test series win over West Indies in Hamilton</DOC_NAME>
<TEXT>
New Zealand cricketers are eyeing off their first Test series in seven years after crushing the West Indies by an innings and 73 runs in Wellington on Friday Captain Brendon McCullum allowed himself a beaming grin when he faced the media able to finally discuss a win and the chances of recording a rare series victory in Hamilton next week The 32 year old had been praised for his aggressive tactics and innovative approach but in his 10 previous Tests recorded six draws and four losses The most recent draw came in the first Test at University Oval in Dunedin where they needed 33 more runs to win the game on the fifth day before rain washed out the final session I think we have played some really good cricket McCullum said I look at the three matches we played against England at home in March and we twice put ourselves into winning positions and dictated against a very good team at the top of their game Last week we could have won again and when you put this result on thats four out of five Test matches where we have put ourselves in a position to win games I think this will certainly help and give us more confidence that you can play good cricket and get good results when you put the efforts in McCullum is unlikely to pull on the wicket keeping gloves again for New Zealand coach Mike Hesson said on Saturday The 32 year old is battling a long term back injury and has already given up the gruelling role in test matches with BJ Watling taking the gloves in the longest form of the game  New Zealands biggest problem in recent years has been providing their bowlers with a reasonable target to attack or bat time to allow them to refresh before a second innings At least against the West Indies after being inserted on two green pitches the batting unit has provided their bowlers with some respite In Dunedin with Ross Taylor compiling a career best 217 not out they scored 609 runs which allowed McCullum to set attacking fields and give leg spinner Ish Sodhi some rope to bowl the occasional bad ball In Wellington they scored 441 with Taylor and the middle order providing 233 runs before the tail under the guidance of wicketkeeper BJ Watling added 145 runs The bowlers also stuck to their guns bowling full of a length allowing the ball to swing and then seam off the pitch and forcing the West Indies batters to play at deliveries A succession of maidens and low scoring overs put more pressure on the tourists who did not seem content to occupy the crease as they had in their second innings in Dunedin when they scored 507 runs The first Test we batted well in the second innings this Test we barely faced 100 overs which is not good for any international side West Indies captain Darren Sammy said We all need to get better quickly in order to beat this New Zealand team at home  but the last Test makes it very interesting Sammys bowlers would probably spend time in the nets trying to adjust their lengths after bowling too short in the first Two tests while he said there could be personnel changes at Seddon Park Yes every single team member will have to come into consideration he said of the third test in Hamilton The Windies must win in Hamilton to ensure the hosts do not secure their first series win against a major cricketing nation since 2006 when they beat West Indies 2 0 in a three Test series at home So far weve got two grassy tops and weve not been able to get the wickets Probably the Narine factor will come into play he added of off spinner Sunil Narine who has taken 12 of his 15 career wickets against New Zealand Ive guess weve found ourselves in these situations a few times and I believe we have the mettle in the dressing room to come back and keep remaining hungry I believe we have what it takes to level the series   Reuters Topicscricketsportnew zealand     First posted           December 14 2013 085554

<DOC_NAME>Brisbane Roar maintain winning form with 2-1 win over Wellington Phoenix</DOC_NAME>
<TEXT>
Wellington coach Ernie Merrick believes his side is not out of the A League playoffs race yet but concedes the Phoenix will be if his players cannot start scoring goals after their 2 1 loss to Brisbane The Phoenix who have yet to win this season and were ninth on the ladder heading into this weekends fixtures arguably played their best 90 minutes of football against league leaders Brisbane Roar in Wellington on Saturday   But their inability to score despite putting the Roar under sustained pressure and making keeper Michael Theo work hard was costly again as they went down at Westpac Stadium Carlos Hernandez broke his goal scoring duck for the Phoenix from the penalty spot early in the second half after Brisbane defender Matt Smith had given his side a 1 0 halftime lead against the run of play Keeper Glen Moss then gave the Phoenix hope when he saved a Besart Berisha penalty in the 65th minute only for Ivan Franjic to curl home the winner 16 minutes from time in a repeat of the Roars first round victory in October There were more than enough chances to win the game and the stats will show how well we played said Merrick But the stat that matters is the number of goals and they werent there We must start scoring goals or else we will miss out on the finals I still think there is time to be in the finals but weve got to start scoring goals Jeremy Brockies glaring miss in the 26th minute summed up the Phoenixs season so far The unmarked New Zealand international striker blazed over the bar from six yards out with the goal at his mercy The Roars opener came in the 37th minute when Smith got a toe to Thomas Broichs free kick to the back post despite the despairing dive of Ben Sigmund Ben had him marked but he slipped and the other player slipped but somehow the other player got his foot to it and it just rolled into the goal Have you seen that working for us lamented Merrick The second half was the tale of two penalties before Franjic who scored the late winner in round one struck the killer blow It probably appears to them at the moment that theres no end in sight for them in terms of getting points said Roar coach Mike Mulvey But if they continue to play the way they did Im sure they will pick some points up very soon Brisbane Roar 2 M Smith 37 I Franjic 74 Wellington Phoenix 1 C Hernandez pen 48  AAP  Topicssportsoccera leaguebrisbane 4000qldaustralianew zealand     First posted           December 14 2013 180522       More stories from Queensland
