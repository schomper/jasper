<DOC_NAME>TEPCO clean-up boss says Fukushima's radioactive water will be dumped into Pacific Ocean</DOC_NAME>
<TEXT>
The man in charge of the clean up at Japans Fukushima nuclear plant says growing stores of contaminated water from the site will eventually have to be dumped into the sea In an exclusive interview with the ABC the chairman of the Fukushima Monitoring Committee Dale Klein has also admitted there are likely to be more blunders and slip ups at the plant in the months and years to come I think the best word to use with Fukushima is challenging the former chief nuclear watchdog in the US said   Since the 2011 earthquake and ensuing tsunami sparked the nuclear disaster TEPCO has been pouring millions of litres of water onto Fukushimas reactors to try and keep them cool That radioactive water is now being stored in tanks at the site but already thousands of litres have leaked into the Pacific Ocean Mr Klein says the biggest challenge for TEPCO is dealing with these ever growing volumes of contaminated water being stored at Fukushima He believes that after the water is treated and stripped of most radioactive elements it will be safe to dump into the Pacific At the end of the day when the water is discharged it will be released in a way that its diluted he said So theres no risk to public health and safety But its an emotional issue It is not just contaminated water causing problems at Fukushima  Hastily and shoddily built systems at the nuclear plant have also triggered some anxious moments The ABC has spoken to one man who worked at the Fukushima site until he reached his maximum radiation exposure limit He still works for TEPCO and only agreed to speak to the ABC on the condition of anonymity I was at the plant earlier this year when a rat chewed through some wiring and knocked out power to several used fuel pools he said I thought how could one rat cause such a big problem There were no back up systems Mr Klein has told the ABC he believes there will be more dramas at Fukushima I think we will see more of those When you look at that site its massive he said Its a big site and its not unusual to have other things like that   Topicsnuclear issuesnuclear energynuclear accidentenvironmentjapanpacific     First posted           November 20 2013 123037     Contact Mark Willacy
