<DOC_NAME>Paid parental leave scheme: first steps towards Greens, Coalition Government talks</DOC_NAME>
<TEXT>
The ABC understands preliminary discussions are underway between the Federal Government and the Greens about a new paid parental leave scheme Yesterday Prime Minister Tony Abbott suggested he may need to consider amendments to the scheme through the Senate The Coalition wants to provide new mothers earning up to 150000 a year their full replacement salary for six months The Greens want the scheme capped at 100000 a year Greens Senator Sarah Hanson Young says while the Greens support the Coalitions scheme they are pushing for a less generous version The Greens obviously want to see a scheme that is capped at a 100000 income for six months thatd be up to 50000 she said That would capture over 90 per cent of working mothers Thats a good compromise and were willing to keep talking and to negotiate with the government on this The scheme is slated to begin in 2015 at a cost of 55 billion a year partly paid for by a 15 per cent levy on big business   to be offset by a corporate tax cut The Federal Government has come under pressure to scale back the scheme given the dire economic forecasts it released yesterday in the Mid Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook Topicsgovernment and politicsabbott tonyworkworld politicsfederal governmentwelfaresocial policyaustralia     First posted           December 19 2013 144431
