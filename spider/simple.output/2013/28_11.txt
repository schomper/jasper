The sound of the shears rings out loudly from the shed as Glyn Shackleford and Chris Clarke work quickly to finish a few more lambs before lunch Mannanarie farmer Ruth Robinson runs about 2800 sheep on her property in South Australias mid north and her small team are on their second to last day of shearing Rouseabout Lyndon Jacka says its not easy work  Between them theyre doing about 55 to 60 sheep a run depending on how tough the sheep are or how hard they kickIts a big job it takes a while especially this close to harvest   Im a farmer as well I actually went reaping over the weekend and Ive left my brother and father to work on that so I can come here for the last two days Ruth Robinson is use to the yearly shearing ritual having managed the property for 34 years Her interest in agriculture was sparked during high school and she was amongst the first group of women allowed to study at the Roseworthy College in Adelaide in 1974 The previous director had retired and he had made the statement that girls would be let into Roseworthy over his dead body   so it all just fell in line very nicely So there were 10 girls among the total intake that year of 50 The property has about 1200 breeding ewes which Ms Robinson says translates to about 2700 in total with lambs and hoggets at shearing time She says the season this year has been very good Weve had a lot of winter rain after a very ordinary spring last year   spring last year and autumn this year were very very hard on the sheep Im aiming to produce sort of 20 to 22 micron wool and we aim for as cleaner wool as possible and less than 1 per cent grass seedIve certainly achieved that again this year by having the sheep on spray top paddocks leading up to shearing Ruth Robinson says shes adopted a rotational grazing model running large mobs of sheep on a small amount of land for a short amount of time So you basically crash graze it which makes the sheep eat less selectively so they clean up everything thats there and then you move them onto a different paddock That allows the paddock that theyve moved off of to have a greater recovery time and so it actually promotes more total pasture production over a 12 month period At 12 o clock on the dot the shears are switched off and the team makes its way down to the house for lunch Its an important part of the work day and meal breaks are non negotiable Ruth Robinsons daughter Catherine Voumard a lawyer in Darwin is back on the family farm for a few weeks taking up the crucial role of shearers cook The roast lamb lunch is the second meal shes prepared for the day and theres still one more to go for the afternoon breakI think my desk job is far easier really she says But its good fun and they work hard in the shearing shed which is probably why they can eat three meals a day and still go home and eat their dinner too Topicslivestockwooljamestown 5491     First posted           November 28 2013 114249       More stories from South Australia
