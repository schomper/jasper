<DOC_NAME>Warren Mundine raises concern about plans to cut funding to Indigenous domestic violence service</DOC_NAME>
<TEXT>
A key Government appointee in Indigenous affairs has spoken out against planned cuts to an organisation which helps Aboriginal victims of domestic violence Administrators of the National Family Violence Prevention and Legal Service NFVPLS are expecting to lose 35 million in funding over the next three years and have disputed a Federal Government commitment that frontline services would not be affected The chairman of the Prime Ministers Indigenous Advisory Council Warren Mundine says the funding should not be cut He says although cuts to Indigenous legal aid programs were necessary he does not think the NFVPLS program is the right place to start  It is really tough because we need to ensure that we are working hard in this area because it is a very crucial area for us he said What it really means for us in the council is we need to get on top of this very quickly We have to then have a conversation back with the Government about okay what are the outcomes we need to have in this area   How do we ensure that the funding and that the proper programming that it replaced to ensure that we are reducing the rate of domestic violence and violence within Aboriginal communities overall Attorney General George Brandis issued a statement to AM saying funding will be stripped from policy reform and lobbying activities   and he says frontline legal services would not be affected But the national convenor for the program Antoinette Braybrook disagrees  The Family Violence Prevention Legal Service program does not get funding for policy and law reform so Im not sure how they can say it is only to that and frontline services wont be affected she said That 36 million cut to our program will have to come from frontline service delivery Were always at capacity and trying to manage those high caseloads So we are under resourced now and these cuts will only contribute to us not being able to meet that demand A woman who the ABC will call Jane credits the program   one of four being targeted for government cuts   with her escape from a violent home I was a victim of family violence for seven years she said   And so it just escalated to a point where it was dangerous for myself and that it was dangerous for the children Jane says it was important to find a service that understood her culture It meant that I didnt need to have to explain my position as an Aboriginal woman and mother she said It meant that I was working with Aboriginal workers as well and it meant that when I have the service in court that they were able to speak as if I was the one that was speaking about my situation as an Aboriginal woman Topicsindigenous aboriginal and torres strait islandercommunity and societyindigenous policyfederal governmentgovernment and politicsdomestic violenceaustraliant     First posted           December 23 2013 090450
