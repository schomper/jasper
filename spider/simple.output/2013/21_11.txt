<DOC_NAME>The Ashes: Australia will wait out Ian Bell in attempt to bore the England danger-man out</DOC_NAME>
<TEXT>
Ian Bells series defining performance during the last Ashes series is looming front and centre as Australia plan for the England run machine this time around But until further notice the best they can come up with is to be more patient Australia has been open about plans to nick off Cook bounce Trott and pitch up to Root But the bowling tip sheet on Bell for the first Test in Brisbane is a little less dynamic The grand plan centres on beating the most stoic batsman in Test cricket at his finest strength Australian all rounder Shane Watson also believes the Gabba bounce will offer a stern test of Bells technique But if that does not work the home side are prepared to pop on the kettle bring a good book and camp out for as long as it takes to bore a mistake out of Englands number five Bell scored 562 runs at 6244 with a century in each of Englands three wins during the last series in the UK The Australians know they may need to play the waiting game before uncovering a weakness We just have to be more patient than him Watson said We have to find ways to try and expose certain parts of his technique  but also we need to be more patient than he is   He is a very patient test batsman and knows his game very well He has a very good defence We have to find ways to try and expose certain parts of his technique  but also we need to be more patient than he is Thats certainly where his game has developed and he has been very hard to dismiss Overall however Bell has experienced mixed fortunes against Australia especially in his two trips down under where it took him 10 Tests to make a breakthrough hundred in Sydney in 2011 Leg spin has proven a problem for Bell with Shane Warne his earliest tormentor and Steve Smith dismissing him twice at Lords in July Even 20 year old Victorian leg spinner James Muirhead had Bells measure last week in a tour match Test great Mark Waugh praised Bell as a better batsman than 100 Test man Kevin Pietersen who he thought had really only excelled on flatter pitches Watson said the famous Gabba bounce would also test out Bells text book batting Conditions are slightly different and that bit of bounce will test out his technique Watson said He has a very good defence We have to find ways to try and expose certain parts of his technique and that will be a very good challenge for us He scored crucial runs in the last series when his team needed it   AAP Topicsashescricketsportbrisbane 4000qldaustralia     First posted           November 21 2013 072306       More stories from Queensland
