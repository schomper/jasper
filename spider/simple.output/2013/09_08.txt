Rupert Murdochs papers reputed swing elections six oclock news already influential social media getting bigger day appears days over writes Barrie Cassidy Rupert Murdoch every right use media clout try bring change government Australia Thats essence free press However so runs risk exposing limited clout influence rapidly changing media landscape As stands using polls betting agencies guide Murdoch get way matter extent influence Nevertheless risk exists Labor victory odds   face concerted campaign newspapers   would mark third series humiliations rebuffs around globe Murdoch already disgraced UK The phone hacking scandal huge involving 3000 mobile phone numbers famous murder victim Scores people charged evidence emerged improper dealings newspaper editors politicians police Murdoch compounded credibility problems following chastened performance Leveson Inquiry description whole episode the biggest inquiry ever next nothing secret tape recording staff meeting Now politicians put much distance Murdoch possibly can In United States experience presidential election wasnt humiliation Murdoch rebuff Barack Obama comfortably re elected even though Murdochs Fox News watched cable news service America ran hard him According Pew Research Centre Fox News devotes 55 per cent content commentary opposed news gathering Thats lot opinion To fair though free air networks United States   CBS ABC NBC   often accused tilt left Another cable news network MSNBC doesnt bother defend accusations left wing tilt devote 85 per cent content opinion In case many upset see blatant bias simply stop watching meaning networks left preaching largely converted Unless deliver bias entertaining way Jon Stewart does making looking away almost impossible The point is whether influence real imagined somebody like Murdoch hates losing side Picking fight Murdoch aligning Coalition him hardly dangerous strategy might been  In Australia Murdoch campaign is largely restricted newspapers When Daily Telegraph day one campaign ran banner headline Kick This Mob Out Rudd returned fire A columnist The Australian accused Rudd declaring war News Ltd He did way United States declared war Japan   Japanese bombed Pearl Harbour Picking fight Murdoch aligning Coalition him hardly dangerous strategy might been The Rudd camp try portray willingness stand media bully discredited one that The tactic might cause group   parts   go even harder Labor But much influence anyway There lot research subject one interesting experiments carried group Yale University ahead gubernatorial race 2005 The researchers offered 1000 people free copies left leaning Washington Post three weeks 1000 people copies right leaning Washington Times  Most news bad Republicans state Iraq war However Times nevertheless presented bad news favourable light Post Those receiving Post   checking initial voting intentions reality   11 per cent likely vote Democrats But surprisingly 7 per cent reading Times also likely switch Democrats The researchers concluded readers much influenced stance paper increased exposure news The underlying facts matter spin mattered most Perhaps comparable situation Australia week reporting spending initiatives Labor Coalition Labors announcements 200 million car industry 450 million school child care presented Murdoch papers cash splash Yet Coalitions announcement 5 billion cuts company taxes portrayed boost economic growth Based Washington experiment readers weigh child care versus company tax cuts The slant wont important In case Daily Telegraph trying influence people already savvy interested enough buy newspaper declining market They dont fit lemming mentality large So newspaper campaigns limited impact The six oclock news still influential
