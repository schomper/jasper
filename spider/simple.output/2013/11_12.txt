<DOC_NAME>The Ashes: Memorable WACA moments between Australia and England</DOC_NAME>
<TEXT>
Since debuting as a Test venue during the 1970 71 Ashes series the WACA has provided plenty of memorable moments Grandstand has taken a look through the history books to come out with a selection of those moments we will never forget   The 1970 Ashes Test at the WACA was full of firsts It was the first time a Test had been played at the venue and the first time a new Ashes Test venue had been introduced since the Gabba in 1928 29 But it was also the first Test for a young South Australian named Greg Chappell After carrying the drinks in the first Ashes Test of the summer in Brisbane Chappell was called on to make his debut at the WACA He came to the crease with Australia 5 for 107 having dismissed England for 397 in its first innings Chappell took 40 minutes to get off the mark before warming to the task  He hit 58 runs in an hour after tea combining with Ian Redpath who compiled 171 the highest Ashes score at the WACA for a 219 run sixth wicket partnership The future Test captain finished with 108 and became the 11th Australian to score a century on debut Australia scored 440 in the first innings before England declared at 6 for 287 in its second innings  The game eventually ended in a draw with Australia 3 for 100 in its second innings   After Australia won the first Test in Brisbane England recalled 42 year old Colin Cowdrey who was called up to play two days after arriving in the country But Cowdrey could do little as the visitors were bowled out for 208 in their first innings In reply Australia was 4 for 192 when Doug Walters strode to the crease He took control of the game after tea bringing up his half century in 44 minutes Not content with that Walters smashed Bob Willis for six from the last ball of the day to bring up his century the first Australian to score an Ashes century in a session since Don Bradman Walters was dismissed the next day for 103 but the damage had been done with Australia going on to post 481 Jeff Thomson claimed 5 for 93 in Englands second innings as the visitors were bowled out for 293 and Australia went on to score the 21 runs required for victory   Englands 1979 80 tour had plenty of spice right from the start  It came on the back of a 1978 79 Ashes tour that saw England thrash an Australian side which had had its playing stocks reduced by Kerry Packers World Series Englands cricket board had then refused to grant this tour Ashes status On the second day of the first Test at the WACA Australian bowling great Dennis Lillee emerged on the ground carrying a bat made from aluminium After four deliveries and three runs England captain Mike Brearley complained the bat was damaging the ball Play was held up as umpires persuaded Lillee to swap his bat for one made of traditional willow In the same match Ian Botham took 11 for 176 including 6 for 78 and 5 for 98 which were his best figures against Australia   As the first Ashes Test of the summer at the WACA meandered to a draw the crowd became restless As England notched up 400 a group of fans some holding Union Jacks stormed on to the field to celebrate One fan clipped Terry Alderman on the head as he ran past and the swing bowler gave chase tackling the fan to the ground  Alderman fell awkwardly dislocating his shoulder an injury that would keep him out for more than a year Australia captain Greg Chappell later led his team off the ground for 14 minutes and 26 arrests were made   The WACA Ashes Test of 2006 started with some drama as Andrew Symonds was called into the team to replace Damien Martyn who had shocked everyone with his sudden retirement Batting first Australia scored 244 before bowling England out for 215 Michael Clarke scored 135 not out in Australias second innings but his performance was virtually forgotten thanks to the efforts of keeper Adam Gilchrist Gilchrist took the England bowling attack apart recording the second fastest Test century in history in just 57 balls one more than the record held by West Indies great Viv Richards Amazingly Gilchrist failed to score from seven of the first nine deliveries he faced Soon after Gilchrist brought up his century Australian captain Ricky Ponting declared the innings England was bowled out for 350 in its second innings allowing Australia the win and a 3 0 series lead to reclaim the Ashes it lost in the 2005 series in England Topicsashescricketsportperth 6000waaustralia     First posted           December 11 2013 185912       More stories from Western Australia

<DOC_NAME>Armed officers at schools: NT Police Commissioner defends decision as 'operational' </DOC_NAME>
<TEXT>
Police Commissioner John McRoberts has defended a decision to arm officers who work at schools The Australian Education Union has raised concerns that youth engagement officers have been carrying guns at Northern Territory schools since last Thursday   Mr McRoberts says police commanders and not politicians made the decision about the officers carrying regulation weapons including fire arms which came into force last week You expect and we often hear about a request for police officer to be at sporting events they have their weapons he said Police officers patrol shopping centres  this is the environment police officers work in Mr McRoberts says it makes operational sense to give firearms to police officers who work in schools and they can be trusted to carry guns  These officers are sworn trained highly trained professional police officers he said When they leave the police station each day they are like any other police officer who might be seen in the community The Australian Education Union AEU says the change happened suddenly AEU NT branch president Matthew Cranitch says schools were given no advanced knowledge We are unsure as to why it has happened so quickly and why there was not more consultation or discussion about it he said Certainly teachers are shocked The kids know little about it We have not heard yet from parents but we anticipate we will get a lot of inquiries from parents and school councils in the coming months We have been told that they police will be fully armed and operational as of last week A police spokesman says the officers are front line personnel and they have to be ready and available to respond to emergencies outside the schools He says there was some discretion among commanders in the past over whether the officers wore their weapons but that is not the case now  Topicspoliceschoolsntdarwin 0800     First posted           December 11 2013 110631       More stories from Northern Territory

<DOC_NAME>The Ashes: England must find an X-factor if it is to reverse its Ashes fortunes in Perth Test</DOC_NAME>
<TEXT>
The bouncing ball has unnerved England mainly in the left hand of Mitchell Johnson but his accomplices have been potent Ryan Harris 3 for 54 and Peter Siddle 4 for 57 shared the spoils in Englands second innings after Johnson had bounced Alastair Cook into a top edge dismissal This imposing and disciplined trio are winning the series for Australia whereas Englands new ball potency has faded with the hard working Jimmy Anderson and Stuart Broad rebuffed by Australias improved batting and a lack of reverse swing on truer pitches Going into the Perth Test England has an X factor no other contemporary Test side possesses   KP If Kevin Pietersen turns up at the WACA he can turn the series around Or so the fan club of this outrageously talented batsman would have us believe Heres the pitch based on seven Ashes Tests this year The team that wins the toss and bats invariably wins England at Trent Bridge Lords Durham Australia had the running at Old Trafford and the Oval and controlled then won at the Gabba and Adelaide So anticipation leans to England winning the toss in Perth and so on Alastair Cook chooses to ignore Englands poor record in Perth asserting that history is irrelevant Thats why he needs a KP blitz accompanying his own rejuvenation and some faster bowling from Anderson controlled belligerence from Broad supported by Tim Bresnan and one of the tall men out of Steven Finn Chris Tremlett and Boyd Rankin Collectively a four man pace attack is Englands only option because Graeme Swann has been ineffective and Monty Panesar unlikely on a true bounce pitch  Momentum shifts can be sudden and alarming in these matches and while its unlikely that Australia will relinquish its intimidatory disciplined hold on the minds of Englands batsmen the KP factor can ignite a seismic swing So here are the what ifs for Perth With some unsubtle sledges spicing the theatrics Cook percolates while Ian Bell KP and Matt Prior counter attack Bresnan and Broad find the right length David Warner and Shane Watson become the two Ws LBW will stay off limits try DRS if you like for gun shy umpires And if Johnson adds an occasional in swinger to his express head banging bombs Nathan Lyon will be singing the team song in Michael Clarkes memorable 100th Test Topicsashescricketsportperth 6000waaustralia     First posted           December 11 2013 075607       More stories from Western Australia
