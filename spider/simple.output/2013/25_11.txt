<TEXT>
The federal Member for Indi Cathy McGowan has defended her decision to vote against the repeal of the carbon tax in Parliament saying her vote reflected the opinions of a majority of her electorate Some sectors of the business community labelled Ms McGowan as being out of touch for supporting the tax but she says many in Indi share her view that a market based mechanism is the best way to reduce carbon emissions Ms McGowan says the tax will still be repealed regardless of her vote but she will continue to work towards cutting carbon pollution I think the business community should be really happy with the result that theyve got that the carbon tax will be removed and then Im going to be very proactive working with the Government on how were going to get that 5 per cent emission decrease by 2020 she said Ms McGowan says her belief in a market based way of reducing pollution was widely known and she hopes Indi will become a leading player in a new low carbon economy Thats where our growth will come from thats where our new jobs will come from and that we will make a transition from high carbon to low carbon and it will be communities in Indi that will be leading edge on new low energy low carbon emissions really creative ways of being totally environmentally friendly she said Topicstaxfederal parliamentfederal governmentclimate changewodonga 3690shepparton 3630   More stories from Victoria

<TEXT>
The Victorian Coroner has ordered an inquest into the gangland killings of police informer Terence Hodson and his wife Christine The Hodsons were shot dead at their Kew home in May 2004 at the height of Melbournes gangland wars when Hodson was due to give evidence against disgraced detective Paul Dale  He was charged with the murder of Terence Hodson  A hit man who cannot be named was also charged over the double murder The charges against both men were dropped after convicted killer Carl Williams who had incriminated them was killed in jail in 2010  Mr Dale has always maintained his innocence The inquest will concentrate on who killed the couple and the protection they were given immediately before their deaths  Hodson family lawyer Alex Lewenberg says they are relieved there will be an inquest Theyve waited four and a half years to get there and Im very pleased for them he said It took a long time for common sense to prevail In their submission the Hodsons daughters argued their father was mismanaged by his handlers which meant many in the criminal world knew he was an informer They said he should have been given greater protection as a result especially after agreeing to give evidence against Mr Dale Mr Dales lawyer said the inquest should not be limited to the former drug squad detectives potential involvement in the case Acting Police Chief Commissioner Graham Ashton says it is not a closed case Its left a lot of questions unanswered that crime he said Were still actively investigating as much as we can and any new information will be actively and vigorously looked at We certainly hope that a coroners inquest will do much to provide some more certainty particularly for the community in understanding what happened in that terrible crime and exactly why it occurred In August Police Chief Commissioner Ken Lay said Mr Dale was still a suspect The inquest is set to begin in May Topicscourts and trialspolicemurder and manslaughtercorruptionmelbourne 3000kew 3101     First posted           November 25 2013 125959       More stories from Victoria

<DOC_NAME>Where Kennedy dreamed, Johnson achieved</DOC_NAME>
<TEXT>
On any measure bar retrospective acclaim Lyndon B Johnson was a far superior domestic president than his predecessor ushering in the civil rights and welfare reforms that have since been taken for granted writes Chip Rolley So you think youve seen and heard enough now about the 50th anniversary of the death of John F Kennedy Enough of the Texas School Book Depository the fateful day the city of hate and the only place on earth where a rise in a road embankment is referred to as a grassy knoll Sorry but there is a little unfinished business Last Friday was not just the 50th anniversary of the assassination of JFK It was also the 50th anniversary of the swearing in of Lyndon B Johnson This is always overlooked and as result so is the extraordinary domestic legacy of Americas 36th President Perhaps its becauseIm a native son of Texas that Im a little sensitive to this Or perhaps its because on any objective measure of progressive politics the presidency of LBJ far outstripped the presidency of the man whose legacy seems to be even more exaggerated with every passing year Perhaps also there is more at stake here than merely comparing the success of one dead president to another For too long now we have held one up as a model president at the expense of the other and in so doing haverewarded celebrity over substance propaganda over reality unfulfilled promise over pragmatic accomplishment These things matter They go to what it is we value what it is we expect a president or indeed a prime minister to do But Im getting ahead of myself For 50 years the Kennedy propaganda machine has been telling us what he was likely to have done had he lived but rarely if ever facing up to how little he did while he was in office Part of the work of that machine has been to cast Kennedy favourably in contrast to his successor For many in the American eastern establishment LBJ was illegitimate   there only because the real president had died and who according to some among the conspiracy set might well even have been involved in the assassination In fact you dont need to look to the tinfoil hat brigade to find a seething distrust of and in some cases disgust with Johnson For a substantial number of Americans LBJ has always been the crude farting yes sadly he was known to let one loose in the presence of his advisors corrupt pretender to the thronewhose presidency is synonymous with Americas supposed end of innocence and lapse into the disgrace of Vietnam Part of this is Johnsons fault He cast his own presidency as a caretaker of Kennedys even as he substantially recast the agenda moving civil rights and poverty programs to the fore Reflecting on his presidency in 1971 he said I considered myself the caretaker of both his people and his policies  I did what I believed he would have wanted me to I never wavered from that sense of responsibility even after I was elected in my own right up to my last day in office This might be false humility and a sharing of the blame with Kennedy for Vietnam a part of Kennedys and Eisenhowers agenda even if he took it up with what can only be described as a fair amount of gusto But there should be no doubt Johnson wanted to be remembered as a great president The alacrity with which he opened his first presidential library   just two and a bit years after his term came to a close and nine years before JFKs   is perhaps one sign that he wanted historians wasting no time in getting to work on the building of his legacy The 1000 days of the JFK presidency was enough time for him to have used the office to do what hed set out toHe had already reached the point of least efficacy in a presidential first term   when presidents must build not spend political capital Lets remember why Kennedy was in Dallas in the first place He was in re election mode and by no means assured of victory Texas had threatened to turn against him The trip was meant to shore up support While Kennedy advocated action on civil rights and poverty he was anaemic in delivering them In slightly anachronistic American parlance Kennedy talked the talk but didnt come anywhere close to walking the walk Take civil rights The popular wisdom is that Kennedy ran out of time and Johnson merely implemented his agenda helped by the gift of national unity in the wake of the assassination The truth is more complicated Both Kennedy and Johnson knew that civil rights legislation would have a devastating impact on the political fortunes of the Democratic Party in the south But their approach to this knowledge could not have been more different Kennedy let that fear control his actions He acted to protect civil rights but no more than Eisenhower before him  In fact his caution placed him on the wrong side of history If Martin Luther King had listened to Kennedy and not marched on Washington then that memorable I have a dream speech would not have been made Johnson on the other hand a week after the Bloody Sunday in Selma Alabama when state and local police attacked voting rights protesters with billy clubs and tear gas went to Congress to ask it to pass a bill enshrining Voting Rights This was Johnsons second try at voting rights Congress stripped voting rights provisions out of the Civil Rights act Johnson secured in the wake of Kennedys assassination as sure a sign as any that the assassination had not made these issues a cakewalk for the new president In his remarkable speech Johnson placed the African American struggle for equal rights in the wider context of the American struggle for liberty In adopting the movements most prominent slogan no one would be left wondering if there was any space between his views as a Southern Democrat synonymous at the time with restrictions on African Americans and the civil rights movement Their cause must be our cause too Because its not just Negroes but really its all of us who must overcome the crippling legacy of bigotry and injustice And we shall overcome   Johnson also linked civil rights to the alleviation of poverty for black and white Americans the policy area what would become the other great achievements of his presidency One is hard pressed to find any great domestic achievement from Kennedys thousand days Both the Peace Corps and rejuvenation of the space program had Cold War foreign policy objectives at their heart His historic peaceful resolution of the Cuban missile crisis again foreign policy came in the wake of the disastrous foray into the Bay of Pigs a failed CIA invasion of Cuba which gave the USSR licence to place the missiles in Cuba that led to the later crisis Johnson used the moral authority of his background in poverty stricken rural Texas to anchor his domestic policy achievements He pushed through a raft of legislation that not only dwarfs Kennedys legacy but makes him second only to Franklin D Roosevelt among reforming 20th century presidents The tragedy of Johnsons presidency is that he is remembered more for escalating Kennedys war in Vietnam than for the way he transformed the lives and prospects of millions of disadvantaged Americans But we should not let our grief about the assassination blind us to the accomplishments of the man who assumed the mantle and used it to far greater domestic effect than Kennedy could ever have dreamed of Chip Rolley is editor of The Drum online Born and raised

closed but you can still  have your say 25 Nov 2013 41517pm Civil rights for oppressed Americans yes but human rights for the Vietnamese no All the way with LBJ No way Alert moderator 25 Nov 2013 82021pm Unfair Ataraxia Chip made a very careful distinction in what he wrote and restricted it to Johnsons domestic policies as set against the lionising of KennedyI congratulate him for correcting the historical record in order to defend the Johnson legacyI have no doubt that he would know that he goes where angels fear to tread in relation to the perception Australian baby boomers might have of Johnson And again we must be fair We often have had that cringing feeling at the fawning obseqiousness of several of our Prime Ministers over time Who could forget the Deputy Sherriff remarks of John Howard All of it set against the backdrop of US Foreign policy and thats a whole other story Alert moderator 26 Nov 2013 81350am Who could forget the Deputy Sherriff remarks of John HowardJohn Howard didnt make that remark George Bush said it and John Howard then tried very hard to play down the comment   because obviously it was never going to play well locally Bush really put him in it there given that 10 years later some Australians are crediting Howard with the omment Alert moderator 26 Nov 2013 104746am One word   Vietnam   a horrific episode in US foreign policy LBJ will be remembered for the abhorrent bloodshed of that ghastly war Alert moderator 26 Nov 2013 13944pm Fair comment Eddie but I dont see why you posted that in reply to my post Alert moderator 25 Nov 2013 82442pm Kennedy almost got us all annihilated with the Bay of Pigs debacle   and we were saved from the Missile Crisis by Khrushchevs decision to stand down rather than by Kennedys decision to not blink he would have blinked when the flashes cameLBJ did escalate the Vietnamese War but Kennedy started it The reality is that in the USA at the time Congress didnt even regard many of its own citizens as fully human let alone funny looking foreigners in faraway lands they were simply chips on the game board of Cold War Risk You have to be a human to inherit human rights and at the time that term had a very narrow definition in the USA Alert moderator 26 Nov 2013 81855am Mitor you are believing the USKennedy clan propaganda here Kennedy did blink   he pulled the medium range missiles out of Turkey as a deal to get the missiles out of Cuba And required the Soviets to shut up about it as part of the deal so he did not look weak domestically  Alert moderator 26 Nov 2013 112628am Well then thank God for Kennedy blinking Alert moderator 26 Nov 2013 123820pm fair call Bay of Pigs was inhereted from the previous regime Kennedy took the flak for it as he should have   ultimately the call was his but he never made the mistake of trusting the CIA on such issues again Alert moderator 26 Nov 2013 114946am Mitor The Bay of Pigs incident was the Military Machines doing They lied to Kennedy about what was going to happen and when it blew up in their faces they blamed Kennedy for itKennedy saved us from WWIII because he contacted Khrushchev and they made a deal Khrushchev was also afraid of the Military machine behind himKennedy was a man of peace like most people who ACTUALLY fought in a war rather than the ones who warmed their rear ends and like Cheney et al love war Alert moderator 26 Nov 2013 23446pm It is fortunate he didnt have the negotiatingdiplomatic skills of our current leader Alert moderator 26 Nov 2013 23200pm Damn right Kennedy didnt save the world by not blinking even though he thought so as did pretty much everybody for yearsWell worth watching The Fog Of War a doco about Robert McNamara where he states that even he thought Kennedy won by not blinking until his meeting with Castro many years laterCastro told McNamara that he Castro was demanding Russia nuke the US as the result of the Bay Of Pigs knowing that Cuba would be BBQd as a result but Khruschev would not do itYou can hear McNamara say it from his own lips in the docoIf youre into docos make sure you see it Alert moderator 25 Nov 2013 41932pm JFK did everything he could to maintain the peaceIt was the military machine that was driving the wars Alert moderator 25 Nov 2013 73317pm Thanks for that Science Lover Well put Alert moderator 25 Nov 2013 80611pm Ive just read a story in the latest Rolling Stone MagWritten by Bobby Kennedy Jnr why cant they come with new namesThe Military were pushing for  nuclear strike on the Soviet Union while they still had the upper handKhrushchev had the same problem with the soviet military machineThey lied to Kennedy about what would happen in the Bay of Pigs fiasco and Kennedy had to take the blameKennedy refused to let the Military bomb Laos when the population revolted against the CIA installed leaderJFK was against putting troops into Vietnam because he saw that the French was being humiliated by an enemy that was there but unseenLBJ was a puppet of the Military MachineAfter reading the article it made me think how strange it was that Washington brought Lee Harvey Oswald back from Soviet Russia Possibly brainwashedAn interest quote from the articleduring the Cuban missile crisis my father told the Soviet Ambassador that JFK was worried the Military would overthrow him and seize power Alert moderator 25 Nov 2013 82918pm Imagine what would have happened if theyd had the wise counsel of GW Bush during that fraught period Were all lucky it was a Democrat rather than a Republican with his fingers on the launch codes The only difference between a Republican president and a military one is the uniform   psychologically theres little to distinguish them Alert moderator 26 Nov 2013 124056pm Dont be so silly Eisenhower was a Republican and a former general and he didnt act the way your suggesting Even Nixon didnt although as far as I understand it he had to be talked down from taking such action a couple of times by KissengerThese things are rarely that simple Alert moderator 25 Nov 2013 43319pm Thankyou for some perspectiveOne mans failure is magnified the other mans failures obscured by the rush to make a martyr of an assassinated politician   Style and charisma wins attention over plain and hardworkingIts the story of so many peoples daily existance Alert moderator 26 Nov 2013 24050pm Style and charisma wins attention over plain and hardworkingIsnt that what we have just seen played out here not that I think Julia is plain for one minute   she copped a doublewhammy to boot Alert moderator 25 Nov 2013 43538pm Please no more American yesterdays news there is more important news in Australia then these stories Alert moderator 26 Nov 2013 65313am Actually Its a nice break from asylum seekers  marriage equality global warming sorry thats climate change now isnt it which is all the media in Australia can focus on these days And they wonder why newspaper sales are through the floorAh back in the day there were real issues to discuss Like a potential WW3 and nuclear annihilation communismthings that could affect the entire population and not just sub 1 of the population Alert moderator 25 Nov 2013 44156pm Anybody else spot the eerie similarities with recent times Australia   a fagged out old right winger replaced by a bright and shiny new young thing who was more sparkle than substance The new kid gets assassinated Ok   it turned out our guy had more of a black knight flesh wound but stick with me here and his deputy replaces him and does a whole lot of useful far reaching stuff whilst using up capital political in the case of the US just plain old capital here Finally a sleazy looking right winger takes over after the Golden Age and sends the country down the toilet My guess is if Bill Shorten has ever farmed peanuts for a living we could end up with a long period of Liberal rule starting in 2019 Probably wise to stay away from Australian embassies during his upcoming time on deck as well Alert moderator 25 Nov 2013 71556pm OK so Abbott gets the two terms of Nixon which means the coalition loses power in 2019Shorten plays the one term peanut farming Jimmy carter and gains power in 2019 but loses it in 2022 when your predicted long period of Liberal rule startsWhat will be Abbotts watergate in his second term and who will play the often forgotten Gerald Ford Alert moderator 25 Nov 2013 75956pm The polls suggest Abbott will be remembered as the most negative opposition leader who over promised on silly undeliverable slogans  and placed his party in the catch 22 position of either knifing him in favour of Turnbull thus opening them up to cries of hypocrisy or losing after a rare one term stint Alert moderator 25 Nov 2013 84816pm They were only eerie similarities Esteban not eerie mirror images   I think you can pencil Jimmy Shorten in for as early as 2016Any problems with that probably best to talk to the folk who answered the Fairfax poll Alert moderator 26 Nov 2013 101352am Thanks MJLC thats a clever and amusing analogyTo take it a little further in your parallel universe Keating is Harry S Truman   and if you saw PJK on ABCTV last week youll know that our Paul had a certain fondness for what he dubbed Trumans doctrine of massive retaliation Also Gillard of course didnt re contest her House of Reps seat just as LBJ chose not to seek re election in 68And at the risk of stating the obvious the truth is that while Nixon did terrible things he was also a very intelligent guy who achieved much that was good   including visionary diplomacy think China as well as the USSR AND the formation of the Environmental Protection Agency EPA For those two things alone   three if you include intelligence   its extremely unfair to Nixon to liken him to Abbott Alert moderator 25 Nov 2013 44504pm Thanks ChipI do wonder what President Kennedy would have done about the USS Liberty in 1967 Alert moderator 25 Nov 2013 50305pm Kennedy had the unfortunate impediment of being dead We cant possibly know what he would or wouldnt have done had he not been killed Any amount of supposed revisionism is only matched by the authors wild speculation Alert moderator 25 Nov 2013 75450pm I dont agree that the speculation is so wild  This description of what LBJ achieved bears close examination  Kennedys achievements on the other hand were pretty light on  His speeches were great but fine rhetoric becomes empty if to quote the author he didnt come close to walking the walk on civil rights Alert moderator 25 Nov 2013 50325pm Except that he was putting in place Kennedys ideas We cant know this because Kennedy never had the chance He was potential When you praise LBJ though you need to remember the word Vietnam I dont think LBJ comes out of that one too well to me he will forever be associated with waste and destruction lies and deceit LIke those mongrels who ran South Vietnam were deserving of anything but a noose Must be the Texas air Bush supported anyone no matter how vile Alert moderator 25 Nov 2013 51324pm It could be argued that both Fraser following Whitlam and Johnson following Kennedy took permission to finish the job their mercurial predecessors inspired They each also did some regressive stuff outside of social policy in which it seemed neither were particularly interested But it is hyperbolic to say of Johnson  greater domestic effect than Kennedy could ever have dreamed of because Kennedy clearly did dream of all those things If anything the progressive label JFK wore would have caused him to exercise more restraint Alert moderator 25 Nov 2013 51351pm All the way with LBJ Hey The tragedy of Johnsons presidency is the alacrity with which he escalated the conflict in Vietnam dragging lapdog Australia along for the carnage It was a complete tragedy because the Americans deferred restructuring their wartime economy and to this day continue to use munitions manufacture and military service as an economic base Not just the Vietnamese would disagree with Chips positive analysis the Americans have caused great harm with their need for conflict in their so called National Interest Alert moderator 26 Nov 2013 115239am LBJ was a puppet of the Military Machine in the United States of AmnesiaIf JFK had survived and been re elected he would have stopped the Vietnam stupidity Alert moderator 25 Nov 2013 51808pm Domestically then LBJ who was Kennedys other half when K was president and who obviously would have been privy to the workings of government and policy implementation without taking any personal risk now found himself at the controls and as you say was protector of Ks legacyBut your point is clear that Kennedy was dumbfounded in action  his ideals remained that and part if not most of the reason why is I think because LBJ by contrast and as a conclusion of own perceptions and after the fact too felt the need to complete something  this is of course a great moment of instinct on his part   and not excluding the notion that Kennedys real political intentions were likely reasoned with his 2nd in command anyway Kennedy was part of a family clan too and such a tighter circle of democracy may have inhibited his effectual domestic ambitions such efficacies would have been felt closer to the bone and after Cuba K may have been terrified of shadows Cuba was a group think and we should all be grateful for the Kennedys not being just one Alert moderator 25 Nov 2013 51837pm And yet LBJ remains what he always was   a war mongerNo amount of domestic reform can alleviate the suffering that lies at the feet of his presidency Alert moderator 25 Nov 2013 52006pm Mmmm  Johnson was probably the best domestic policy president the US has had since WW2 In many ways he was another Roosevelt  where Roosevelt initiated the New Deal Johnsons achievements were just as important and probably a lot more far reaching in terms of successive generations That said he used the Kennedy mystique ruthlessly  especially early in his term  to sell his policies to CongressOn Vietnam Johnson was saddled with obligations  but was never a great foreign policy president He tended to believe the simplistic arguments of the hawks the domino theory the evil empire those dirty commies and the militarists to the exclusion of shall we say more moderate voices Hence he up scaled the conflict from almost Day 1 of his presidency based on a childish and relatively uncritical analysis of the likely consequences of said involvement  and left the US deep in the bloody mire as a resultNot his fault  he was a product of his times and essentially a domestic politician with a strangely insular mind set and world view He was incapable of seeing the rest of the world as something distinct from the USA and acknowledging that others may have had the same nationalist and social yearnings that he had as an American patriotFinally Johnson and Vietnam have to be seen in the context of the triumphalism of winning World War 2 a virulent McCarthyism and anti communism that persisted in the early 60s USA and actually had little application to Vietnam the wonderfully tactical rather than guerrilla Korean War that played to American and UN military strengths that had been relatively successfully ended a decade before  and everybody at the time thought the whole problem was going to be one of logistics and tactics at which the US excelledIt may have paid Johnson and earlier Kennedy to look at what actually happened to the French in Vietnam and not to take the example of the envelopment and tactical action of Dien BenPhu to heart  as it was atypical of the French experience and that war in general If they had read Maos Little Red Book and understood the writing of Sun Tzu they may have been better prepared for Vietnam than they actually wereInstead all they saw was that ex colonial Vietnam was a divided county backstopped by China supplied by the Soviet Union in much the same way as Korea had been 10 years before  and that simplistic analysis was what caused all the later problems Alert moderator 25 Nov 2013 52253pm Legislation to protect andor provide for those most in need is not sexy As mainstream as it becomes as oblivious as we can be when walking out of a public hospital having our health needs met by the state its just not something well spend time appreciatingIndeed the many achievements of Gough Whitlam in dragging this country into the modern era tend to be forgotten in favour of the circumstances of his removal Liberal party dominated senate refusing to pass funding Alert moderator 25 Nov 2013 52413pm I wasnt aware of the LBJs achievements as listed in this article I know that after the war when Europe was on its economic knees the US Marshall plan helped Europe recover from the warIt was also the time Coca Cola rolled  its trucks into every European school and introduced a free coke to every child This drink together with the Big McDonald  now threatens world healthNo matter how we would wish for an American front line innovation on welfare and social equity I only see a large opposition to welfare still firmly entrenched in the American psyche The struggle with Obama Care the toting gun culture Perhaps the world needs another LBJ Alert moderator 26 Nov 2013 84812am Thats strange gerard I was at school in those days and I dont recall any free coca cola In fact it was inn the late 50s when it became more widely known and available but that was in Liverpool England Alert moderator 26 Nov 2013 93928am Coca cola has been around since the late 1890s The roll out into European schools was during the late 1940s early 50 The  drink still had about three leaves of the coca plant in concentrated form in each bottleToday many schools and universities have banned the sale Coca Cola on the premises Alert moderator 25 Nov 2013 53230pm Beg to differ ChipBy LBJs own standard his presidency was a utter failureNot only did Johnson preside over the disastrous conflict in Vietnam he completely failed the only policy area he truly cared for providing quality education to allVietnam cost not only lives and prestige In his zeal to out hawk the Republicans Johnson diverted sorely needed resources from education and healthcare to escalate a war that presented neither a clear nor present danger Alert moderator 25 Nov 2013 53405pm The writer makes his case very well and made me re think the legacy of LBJMy only point of contention is that I think the writer understates the importance of the handling of the Cuban missile crisis by JFKFrom multiple reports and biographies I understand it that JFK only had one voice dissenting from the advice of the joint chiefs of staff to attack and attack nowRobert Macnamara said the world was on the abyss of nuclear war and JFK and the dissenting voice saved us Lots of brownie points there Alert moderator 25 Nov 2013 53806pm Chip I think you miss the point  I dont think President Johnson had any other option than to continue down the civil rights path  With President Kennedys assassination rightly or wrongly this was seen as the direction Kennedy had already started the country down  To do otherwise would have been seen as going against his legacy and with it Johnsons own future legacyThis is not to say that the need to act had not been an agreed action by both Kennedy and Johnson before his assassination  Because as we know with the March on Washington the need to act on civil rights was not just being pushed by the black community  There was also a growing white push even if mainly in the northAnd of course the shooting of Martin Luther King and the wider reaction about it in America would have made it doubly difficult not to act   When you look at both the United States and Australia the 1960s was pushed by a groundswell of people to act on racial rights  If Kennedy had been alive to finish his two terms he would have been a part of that 1960 civil rights wave of change and that is probably why he is so linked to it  Because of what could have been his legacy if he had not been assassinated  Those could have beens have a lot of influence on how Kennedy is rememberedAnd the problem with President Johnson LBJ is that he is more remembered for his Vietnam legacy of escalating Americas involvement in that war  That memory tends to overshadow his domestic legacy  And that is not really surprising  If he had not escalated Americas involvement in the Vietnam war his legacy would no doubt be very different Alert moderator 25 Nov 2013 54622pm I can recommend an excellent book on this subject The Years of Lyndon Johnson Volume 4 The Passage of Power by Robert A Caro Beautifully written and debunks numerous Kennedy  Johnson myths Alert moderator 25 Nov 2013 60705pm Im glad you wrote this article Chip Johnson cared about and dealt with many of the United States domestic problems These problems especially the ever growing divide between rich and poor appear to have been placed in the too hard basket by his successors both Democrat and Republican Alert moderator 25 Nov 2013 61044pm LBJ gave us an unwinnable war in VietnamLBJ gave the Americans the great society that failedAmericans went to the moon for JFKYes his domestic record is outstanding but LBJ fails in the charisma stakes  To me it seemed like hubris at the time when Washington under JFK was compared to Camelot now 50 years on I was struck by the fact of just how much I regreted not so much his assassination but what might have been  Like Camelot it is the hint of futures lost the shadow play of possibilities and the way in which it ended that makes JFK a modern day folk tale  Some of his speeches are now part of the English language  Most people know the meaning and the metaphor of Ich bin ein Berliner most people recognise the phrase ask not what your country can do for you ask what you can do for your country   I could go on but I wont the point I wish to make is simple  Compared to LBJ the only phrase that comes to mind is all the way with LBJ  hardly inspiringLBJ did a lot for Americans but it was on the agenda anyway  JFK lead Americans inspired them and gave the rest of us pause to wonder why our politicians couldnt do the same for us  You may say that the vision thing is not as important as bread but some one else once said that man cannot live by bread alone  Under JFK Americans didnt have to but they had the bread anyway Alert moderator 25 Nov 2013

Nov 2013 64000pm A good article  LBJ has never been on my list of great US Presidents but he was above Kennedy in the also rans and this article supports the ratingKennedys presidency from mafia funded and corrupted election victory to his death has been polished promoted and pumped up to make a legend  Had he not been in Dallas that fateful day he may well have suffered a fate similar to Nixon   if not worse as the scandals multipliedLBJ was steered down the wrong course with the expansion of the Vietnam war and his legacy suffered as a consequence along with thousands of Americans and Vietnamese   that aside he was an excellent president   free of much of what afflicted this predecessor and successor to the role Alert moderator 25 Nov 2013 64122pm You seem to have forgotten the Vietnam war It was Johnson who escalated the war at such a horrible cost Alert moderator 25 Nov 2013 80331pm If Johnson was so concerned about civil and human rights why did his government not do more to release the documents that would reveal the truth about the assassination of JFK Why did he order the JFK limousine to cleaned and rebuilt immediately following the assassination What about the Kennedys rights to know who was really responsibleAnd where were Oswalds human rights to a fair trial not trial by media even posthumously Please dont say Johnson believed the Warren Commission horse sht Alert moderator 25 Nov 2013 80414pm Its sad that there are so few respondents to this article prepared to thank the author for educating themMr Rolley thank you for your article While I was aware that Johnson had pushed the Civil Rights Act through Congress I had no idea at all that so many other worthwhile laws were enacted under his watch The list makes for sobering readingWhatever Kennedy might have done had he lived whatever Johnson might have done off his own initiative whatever Johnson failed to do the fact remains that Johnson passed many progressive laws and Americans are better off for themA re examination of Johnsons legacy and reputation is clearly in orderThank you again Mr Rolley Alert moderator 25 Nov 2013 90738pm Its sad that there are so few respondents to this article prepared to thank the author for educating themDavid when I post on The Drum and nobody replies I take it as a compliment an assertion that I have not said anything too stupid or controversial I do hope that Chip takes it in the same vein I did find it to be an informative article Alert moderator 25 Nov 2013 85004pm Where is Obamas LBJ He has talked up a storm but seems to be lacking in the reforms America needs Alert moderator 25 Nov 2013 90619pm I remember what I was doing in 1962 the week that Kennedy almost killed me The brinkmanship over Cuba was one of the many examples of Kennedy the coldest of cold war warriors  The author of this article is stating the pricciple fact of the respective records   the 35th president was all style the 36th was substance The Peace Corps and the Test ban Treaty were Hubert Humphreys ideas Hubert this is your treaty said Kennedy when he signed it LBJ by contrast was the greatest legislator ever to sit in the White House In a triumph of style over substance that pretty well charts the direction of modern politics in the television era Kennedy has soared and Johnson has suffered an eclipse thathas been total he scores only 2 along with Gerald Ford as the man AMericans would most like to see reprise their presidency Yet Johnson delivered Crucially Kennedy talked about de segregating the US came no where near enacting the laws to do so and was concerned not so much about  splintering the New Deal coalition by losing the south and blue collar northern votes too long term for JFK but placating the right wing candidate that everyone knew would be thehis likely challenger in 54 Barry Goldwater LBJ was a flawed giant Kennedy a non descript  congressman and senator who is famous for being famous Alert moderator 25 Nov 2013 91336pm I had the chance to visit the LBJ ranch in Texas for a couple of hours earlier this year   its now a State Park beautiful countryside fat cattle Johnson family graves under a grove of trees The one teacher school Johnson attended as a four year old is still there LBJ trained as a teacher when he graduated from high school and went on to become the principal of a Mexican American school before entering politics During his presidency I understand he put through more education bills than any other president with a large number focussing on attempting to address the educational disadvantages faced by the poor What a shame he is mainly remebered for his role with the Vietnam War without the counterbalance of his role in improving the lives of the disadvantaged in America Alert moderator 25 Nov 2013 92748pm Domestically the legislative record of Kennedy is well below Eisenhower Johnson FDR As Kennedy was a failure at foreign policy family and marital status finance and social policy he remains a kind of promising movie cultish figure of admiration Alert moderator 25 Nov 2013 92840pm The Kennedy assassination I remember being in the common room at school doing my homework around 6 or 7 in the evening We werent aloud to talk during prep However one of the naughty boys had a radio and was listening to Radio Luxembourg with an earphone and suddenly announced the news Of course we used it as an excuse to disrupt the homework as Kennedy was the only icon that we knew apart from Buddy Holly The Beatles DH Lawrence The Rolling Stones Mallory and ChaucerWe werent too bothered with America and Americans at that age and time in England However I do remember a fuss from Johnson about Leyland selling motor vehicles to Cuba Alert moderator 25 Nov 2013 93231pm LBJ certainly debased Americas currency  It used to be backed by silver during LBJs reign it came to be backed by nothing  Could be why that now the US dollar has less than 5 percent of the buying power it had then Alert moderator 26 Nov 2013 123821pm So you cant see any problem with pegging money to a commodityNoThe price of commodities be they silver gold or uranium fluctuate Sometimes they fluctuate a lot What happens to the value of money when that happens Thats right you need to sell or buy said commodity to keep the value where you want to  As you can tell this can be a massive drain on reserves which was part of the problem with this systemThats commodity pegged money out of the way Money that isnt pegged to commodities have value based on how much of it there is around and its functions   A medium of exchange a store of value a unit of accout and depending on who you ask a standard of deferred payment If these functions break down for example if people refuse to accept money in large numbers so the medium of exchange function breaks down then fiat money is worthless as you imply Alert moderator 25 Nov 2013 94335pm Chip you shoud read JFK Why he died and why it matters by James Douglass for a better perspective on the man Kennedy was   a man who was an independant thinker and who was the right man for President in the early 1960s when the war hawks of the industrial military establishment were pushing for war with the Soviets and an invasion of Cuba Kennedy had also realised the futility of a ground war in Vietnam and the stupidity of engaging in a civil war  Its their war theyre the one who have to win it or lose it The book also makes a convincing case that a conspiracy by the CIA felled Kennedy LBJ gave the US the Vietnam War which outdoes any of his other domestic achievements JFK knew that the civil rights bills had to be done when there was popular support by the people   the assassination of JFK helped that to come Also maybe you should show the photo of LBJ getting a wink of the senator as he is sworn in with Jackie in her blood stained suit standing next to him   it might not mean anything sinister but it sure was insensitive Alert moderator 25 Nov 2013 105814pm LBJ stopped the commies in Vietnam Sure they lost the war in Vietnam but it stopped the commies going further and the free world eventually won If it hadnt been for the Vietnam war we would all be speaking Russian Alert moderator 26 Nov 2013 120601pm A very limited view of history there BobHo Chi Minh was a socialist Vietnam hated ChinaThe United States of Amnesia have never been able to tell the difference between communism and socialismIn fact Ho Chi Minh had asked the US for help in forming a Constitution for his countryThe Domino Theory was put out by the US Military MachineVietnam is a communist country now because of the damage done to them by the USwed be now speaking Russian what a jokeIf it hadnt been for the Vietnam war South East Asia would be a much better place Youre forgetting the illegal bombing of Cambodia which brought out the Khmer Rouge  the illegal bombing of LaosThe list goes onThe world would be a much better place if it wasnt for US intervention in South East Asia central America They helped win WWII but since then theyve been bullies that have caused millions of deaths Alert moderator 26 Nov 2013 21121am A rosy view of LBJ which glibly glosses over the simple fact that LBJ could have stopped the Vietnam War from escalating and chose not toAny good he did at home was far outweighed by the millions of lives he adversely affected in the war overseas The world can ill afford too many more LBJs to weak or to blind to control their own military industrial complexKennedy was for me the better president in a heartbeat Bobby would have been even better  Alert moderator 26 Nov 2013 61537am Kennedy was quite unremarkable as a president It was just that he was young and had a glamorous wife Had he not been assassinated he would hardy be mentioned these days Alert moderator 26 Nov 2013 62501am Looks like LBJ is the fool who saddled the US with the Plethera of social programs that are currently driving it broke and breaking its family structuresVoting right for all are certainly important and action was necessary but these socialist programs have been an unmitigated disaster The two types of changes should not be conflated Alert moderator 26 Nov 2013 81101am which social programs have been a disasterand I assume you are not putting any of the blame on the USAs brutal laisse faire style neo corporatism Alert moderator 26 Nov 2013 73901am Johnson was a highly experienced negotiator and legislator He knew how to get stuff through congress   even if it meant bending legislative rules that gummed up the system Johnson never let any deadbeat congressman or arcane legislative rule get in the way of his legislative goals This is something Obama and Harry Reid have only just worked out As a result Johnson passed more liberal domestic legislation than any other President apart from FDR He attempted to improve civil rights and made a genuine attempt to alleviate poverty This record of liberalism still hasnt been beaten although Obama might get there if the democrats can re take congress next year Of course this all gets forgotten because of his one big catastrophic foreign policy mistake Im glad this article corrects the record Alert moderator 26 Nov 2013 80241am I was 15 years old when Kennedy was assassinated and in the following years I did realise that Johnson was the better President  I did not however have a great opinion of either of them there was some good and some bad in them but for me the bad outweighed the goodI Johnsons case he was certainly the better President domestically I dont think that can be sensibly contested  His apparent propensity for his LBJ label was a little odd Alert moderator 26 Nov 2013 84150am Whilst you are right however he was human  a flawed geniusThe impact of Texans on the world has been out of proportion to their size  farting prowessAnd tho Vietnam was a tragedy the US approach of facing communism globally eventually defeated itYour most famous general Grant would have understood this but not the failure of your generals thereCompared to academic Obama LBJ is an absolute giant humanitarian Alert moderator 26 Nov 2013 84630am From his profile pic looks like the writer wasnt even born when LBJ was the President or was only in nappies Yet another writer of history who never lived through what they are commenting on Sigh Alert moderator 26 Nov 2013 102336am Sometimes distance in time gives us a better perspective Alert moderator 26 Nov 2013 100851am With domestic policy Johnson simply continued what JFK startedWhat we can measure Johnson by is his escalation of a war in south east Asia and his terrible managment of that war Alert moderator 26 Nov 2013 10157pm The prime architect of the Vietnam War was Robert S McNamara The US presidents whom he was working for had no other choice but to follow his plans Alert moderator 26 Nov 2013 102438am American policy foreign and domestic Imagine how better the world would be if the USA industrial powerhouse instead of building billions of dollars worth of bombs built billions of dollars worth of bridges A life lived in fear is a life half lived Alert moderator 26 Nov 2013 110644am Lyndon Johnsons very real achievements should be celebrated and his failings acknowledged I admire him for his social program post Kennedy Many would not have done what Johnson did even in those circumstancesKennedy was a great man according to those who knew and worked with him He surprised them all including Johnson who clearly came under that spell This should be acknowledged Johnson a very real rival of JFKs came to admire him enormously He based his presidency on him To me that speaks volumes Eleanor Roosevelt a hard marker of democratic pretenders came to see Kennedy the same way despite early misgivingsJFKs achievements were also significant Foremost among them was the solution to the Cuban Missile Crisis which required a nuanced balance of hard line and soft diplomatic efforts This was an existential threat which Kennedy recognised and defused in an era of Cold War hawks and Eisenhowers escalation of militarism as the solution not to mention Soviet brinksmanshipKennedy got that right Alert moderator 26 Nov 2013 113112am I thought this story was about Mitchell Johnsons brilliant performance in the first Ashes test I was wondering who this fast bowler Kennedy was Alert moderator 26 Nov 2013 15609pm He was the one who bowled Norma Jeane Mortenson for a duck Alert moderator 26 Nov 2013 113532am That is not a valid stance MaggiAfter all Edward Gibbon was not a witness to the events he described in Decline and Fall of the Roman EmpireThe passage of time usually allows more information about historical events and figures to emerge from all kinds of sourcesIncidentally I read a biography of Johnson that was written back in the 70s by one of his staffers  If not sycophantic it was quite uncritical its assessment of his achievements and consequently unconvincing Alert moderator 26 Nov 2013 121325pm General Jack D Ripper Mandrake do you recall what Clemenceau once said about war Group Capt Lionel Mandrake No I dont think I do sir noGeneral Jack D Ripper He said war was too important to be left to the generals When he said that 50 years ago he might have been right But today war is too important to be left to politicians They have neither the time the training nor the inclination for strategic thought I can no longer sit back and allow Communist infiltration Communist indoctrination Communist subversion and the international Communist conspiracy to sap and impurify all of our precious bodily fluids Alert moderator 26 Nov 2013 122114pm This article really is the antithesis of the woulda shoulda coulda argument Mr Rolly seems to forget that John F Kennedy was only in office for two years and yet in that time he guided the US through the Cuban missile crisis and was keen to pull out of Vietnam after the 1964 electionMr Rolley appears to be more of an LBJ fan the All the way with LBJ mantra led all the way to a full scale proxy war with ChinaRussia that cost the lives of millions Alert moderator 26 Nov 2013 123344pm Chip fails to mention the most important   and clearly most overlooked element in the primacy of JFK over LBJ when it comes to historys judgement of both mens presidenciesJackieCompared to Lady Bird Jackie was always going to make sure JFK had the lions share of the glory No doubt LBJ also felt an obligation to the glamorous wife of his former superiorIts always easy though for analysts to overlook the effect of the women behind the men when it comes to historical assessment of things that the human mind wishes to credit with more import and impact than they probably should be assigned Its almost as if accepting the role of someone like Jackie in things of such importance lessens or demeans their historical gravityEven the articles byline image of LBJs swearing in on Air Force One features Jackie in one of the most prominent positions   maybe even more so than LBJ given shes even closer to the camera yet she receives not a single mention not a single word when it comes to assessing the two men   much like Lady Bird is given no mention in what made LBJ the man and President he was let alone how history has treated himPerhaps the treatment of the two leading ladies is a far more illuminating guide to how and why the two men have received what they have in the subsequent decades since the events took place  The first ladies lives and legacy are in their own way a mirror that shines a light upon historys assessment of the men they married and influenced with their own special and unique qualities and abilities Alert moderator 26 Nov 2013 123643pm An excellent article Ive read quite a bit about both and Johnson was clearly a much better Domestic President than Kennedy Unfortunately Vietnam overshadows his legacy when it really shouldnt I struggle to image any Amercian President dealing with that issue well Alert moderator 26 Nov 2013 124315pm Johnson must have been a fascinating person  It seems Robert Caro a man that doesnt even admire LBJ will spend almost his entire working life writing the mans biography up to Part 4 I thinkThat grinding poverty he experienced as a child must have gouged deep scores in him and I am happy to believe it shaped his personality including his boorishness and his concern with social issues  He seems to be the outsider who became an insider  He knew the pressure points he could access to make his Congress compliant  Whether his social reforms were optimal or an overreach bringing about a reaction I cannot say  But I am interested enough to one day read Part 4Kennedy I presume was not an insider and tried to work his way around Congress the long way to go  He sounded fine but that is never enough Alert moderator 26 Nov 2013 22251pm Kennedys were spoiled rich brats Alert moderator 26 Nov 2013 124458pm What a silly stupid irrational articleSo the thousands of American and Vietnamese lives ruined maimed and killed were not a domestic issue Johnson knew America could not win the war but was too much of a coward to admit it and get out  No amount of beneficial domestic policies can make up for the horror of what he perpetrated both for Americans and VietnameseHitler is not remembered for full employment and free holidays but for the devastation he caused to millions  And so should Johnson be remembered a little man who would rather make war rather than lose face and admit defeatA totally despicable creature Alert moderator 26 Nov 2013 24448pm Is the job too big for one man  GWB largely neglected domestic policy after 911  How many Presidents have managed both sides of their job well in difficult times  Arguably ReaganPersonally I am not convinced JFK would have been able to retract from Vietnam had he lived  Given the fear of Communism that had been built up over the years I doubt the public would have gone along with it  The Cuban situation would have only intensified those fears Alert moderator 26 Nov 2013 12250pm The 1000 days of the JFK presidency was enough time for him to have used the office to do what hed set out to  Not quite   he was intending to invite the Soviets into what would have become a joint Moon programme  The question then becomes   would the kudos of a joint Moon programme have stifled Brezhnevs overthrow of Krushchev  If so then the mid 60s deepening of the Cold War may not have occurred Alert moderator 26 Nov 2013 15955pm Nixon wasnt the only president taping all his conversations meetings and phone calls For an insight into how an elected leader with some spine goes about turning the tide of political might to his way it is worth going back to the tapes of Johnsons persuasive style with some heavy hitter Congressional racists in getting civil rights into law He knew he had been mislead on Vietnam and determined to leave a one term office making some change he went all out on civil rights and achieved what he determined to do Alert moderator 26 Nov 2013 35450pm I have read lot on LBJ I have been to his ranchtwice in the beautiful Hills Country of Texas I saw him in Melbourne A man with the character of Henry Bolte and Joh Bjelke but fufilled with a vision of America unexpected for a Texan His early days of stuffed ballot boxes and bribes are an indictment of US voting and its Constitution But his Humanity ovecame all his faults He certainly ended up walking the talk A great leader Alert moderator 26 Nov 2013 40302pm please research the bay of tonkin fiasco and the treachery of the uss liberty then we can talk about how great lbj is Alert
