<DOC_NAME>Usain Bolt sets sights on breaking 200-metre world record in 2014, looking to retire after Rio Olympics</DOC_NAME>
<TEXT>
Jamaican sprint star Usain Bolt has set his sights on breaking his own 200 metre world record in 2014 with no competitions to distract his focus Bolt who was last week named IAAF male World Athlete of the Year for a fifth time captured yet another triple gold haul at the world championships in Moscow this summer defending his 100 and 200m titles before anchoring the Jamaican team to victory in the 4x100 relay But records were off the agenda for Bolt this year despite claiming the world leading 200 time in Moscow   a situation the 27 year old is keen to rectify as he plans his strategy for 2014 Definitely for this season me and my coach have decided to focus on running faster because there is no championship so we are definitely targeting the 200 metres Bolt said during a visit to Tokyos Olympic Stadium on Friday Well see what happens Hopefully I can stay injury free and everything will go well this season and I can break the world record Bolt set the current 200 world mark of 1919 seconds and the 100 record of 958 at the world championships in Berlin in 2009 Its all about not getting injured this season said Bolt Thats my focus and then were going to try to push myself and hopefully get the world record and it will all work out Were going to run a lot more 200 this season and well see if we can get it done Six time Olympic gold medal winner Bolt earlier this year indicated the 2016 Rio Games would be the swansong to his glittering career at the age of 30 before hinting in September that he could carry on for another year But Bolt revealed on Friday his coach believes he is capable of continuing until the Tokyo Olympics in 2020 even if the athlete himself does not share his enthusiasm At the beginning of the season I had a meeting with my coach and we were talking about how long I can go on in track and field for said Bolt I was saying 2017 would be the max and he said I probably could go to the Tokyo Olympics if I wanted to I was like its kind of far So its something on his mind and not on my mind I want to retire in 2017 but even if I dont run here Ill definitely be here because I enjoy watching track and field Well see what happens but I want to retire in 2017 AFP Topicsathleticssportjapan

<DOC_NAME>Monarchists decry Governor-General Quentin Bryce's support for a republic; Coalition says issue 'not a priority'</DOC_NAME>
<TEXT>
Governor General Quentin Bryce has come under fire for voicing her support for gay marriage and an Australian republic with one Coalition Senator describing the comments as a breach of trust Ms Bryce spoke out in favour of gay marriage during her Boyer Lecture address last night stating she hoped Australia might become a nation where people are free to love and marry whom they choose She then added And where perhaps my friends one day one young girl or boy may even grow up to be our nations first head of state It is the first time a governor general has publicly supported a republic while still serving as the Queens representative The republican movement has applauded the comments but the Governor General has drawn fire from other quarters Liberal Senator Dean Smith says Ms Bryce had crossed the line by voicing opinions on two sensitive political issues   Senator Smith says Ms Bryce is held in high regard by many people and he is disappointed she has decided to involve herself in a political debate Last nights departure into current political events will come as a slap in the face to many many Australians and a significant breach of trust because she would know better than most that that central office is so integral to stay above the day to day political fray he said She has stepped across the line in inviting a commentary around two very very sensitive issues The national convenor of Australians for Constitutional Monarchy David Flint says the comments are regrettable and a mistake I think its a great pity because the constitutional system requires that the Crown be above politics so that when the representative of the Crown   which is the Governor General or the Governor   speaks they shouldnt be talking about politics Its just it goes against the position he said There are a number of people who are now going to wonder about her Theres this sense of division that shes created and the position is not intended to be divisive   its intended to unite and be above politics So weve got commentators everywhere on these issues couldnt she have left them alone until she was out of the office Prime Minister Tony Abbott says the Governor General is entitled to express her personal opinion Its more than appropriate for the Governor General approaching the end of her term to express a personal view on a number of subjects and thats what she was doing he said   However Coalition MP Kelly ODwyer says the issue is not a priority for the Government Im somebody who believes that Australia should have an Australian head of state she told Lateline I believe that were a mature democracy and that we can and should have an Australian head of state However Im not sure that this is a number one priority issue right now There are a lot of issues on the to do list and Im not sure this up there in the top 10 Federal Labor MP Graham Perrett says most Australians believe a home grown head of state would be just as capable as a foreign monarch Since the Australia Act in the late 1980s the reality is weve drifted to all intents and purposes a long way away from that British throne he said The idea that because you have some hereditary link to one person makes you better than anyone in Australia is anathema to people you know sensible Australians Greens leader Christine Milne also welcomed Ms Bryces comments saying they reflected aspirations held by many Australians I have no doubt that even the Monarchy sometimes wonders why it has taken Australia so long to get to the point of becoming a republic he said I think Quentin Bryce is showing great leadership as Governor General and she is such a good role model and for her to come out now and support the idea of Australia becoming a republic is very welcome Greens Senator Sarah Hanson Young meantime defended Ms Bryce over her comments on same sex marriage She disagreed with Senator Smiths suggestion that the Governor General had crossed a line in giving her opinion on sensitive political issues It should be an issue that is above politics because it is about love not because it should be dragged through the political debates of different political parties Ms Hanson Young said In the lead up to the federal election our Vote Compass tool measured Australian attitudes on major political and social policies  With more than 14 million responses the data showed support for a republic appeared to have waned since the 1999 referendum on the issue with only 38 per cent in favour of cutting ties to the monarchy  Another 20 per cent were neutral The strongest support for change came from those over 55 years of age Vote Compass asked respondents for their view on the statement Australia should end the monarchy and become a republic Use our interactive charts to explore the response       Topicsrepublicgovernment and politicsmarriagegays and lesbianscommunity and societyhuman interestaustralia     First posted           November 23 2013 092405
