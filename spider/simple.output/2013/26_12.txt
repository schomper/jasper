<DOC_NAME>Concern voiced about exploitation of teenage workers in retail and hospitality jobs</DOC_NAME>
<TEXT>
Concern has been voiced about working conditions for young people in retail and service industries Unions and parents want the health and safety of young people in the workplace taken more seriously Unlike other states South Australia and Tasmania do not have specific child labour laws At a time of year when the spending frenzy reaches fever pitch many of those behind the tills are young people who are earning some pocket money over the school holidays But some face exploitation by their employers A mother who did not want her name revealed said her 16 year old daughter had been treated unfairly She was being quite considerably underpaid and didnt feel confident enough to question that she said There was the other issue that she was expected to be on call and that meant being asked to come in if the business was busier than predicted The woman said the employer was not paying her daughter penalty rates and staff were being bullied She said the manager warned casual staff they would not be given shifts if they were not readily available The mother got in touch with the Young Workers Legal Service in South Australia and found she was one of the hundreds of phone calls they got annually about youth employment matters Nikki Candy is the organisations co ordinator and says stories of bullying sexual harassment underpayment of wages and unfair dismissal are common She thinks specific legislation is needed for workers under 18 What it would do is set a minimum age for young people in the workplace and most importantly it would have provisions that would allow a civil penalty to be available to prosecute employers where they expose children to work that is harmful and contrary to their health and safety she said She also urged there be restrictions imposed on how late young people could work There is anecdotal evidence from teachers and parents in particular having an issue of where young people who are at school are working excessive hours and particularly late night shifts while theyre still at school she said The biggest concern is that this may be having an impact on their education   Legislation specifically covering children was introduced to the South Australian Parliament in 2011 but lapsed Industrial Relations Minister John Rau argues there already are a raft of state and federal regulations which safeguard young workers But he says he is prepared to take another look at the issue Im very happy to look at it and intend to do so in the new year but we dont want to be in a position where we wind up saying that in a small business for example a family business the children are unable to help in the business simply because we pass a law that captures people we dont intend to capture he said This is probably one of the reasons thats held Australia back from ratifying the minimum age convention and its really I think an international embarrassment that Australia has not ratified that convention   Professor Rosemary Owens from Adelaide Universitys law school thinks gaps in Australian child labour laws reflect poorly internationally This is probably one of the reasons thats held Australia back from ratifying the minimum age convention and its really I think an international embarrassment that Australia has not ratified that convention she said Professor Owens says 165 countries have signed the convention but the United States Canada and New Zealand also are among those which have not It sets a minimum age which must be 15 or the school leaving age so the idea is that work shouldnt interfere with education for young children but the convention is flexible which means that it shouldnt hinder any country in signing up she said Mr Rau denies governments have been tardy First of all were not holding out as such were just working our way through the issues and the second thing is Id really like to see the list of those who are signed up because the mere fact of you being on that list or not doesnt determine whether children in your jurisdiction are being abused he said Topicsretailhospitalityindustrybusiness economics and financeyouthcommunity and societyuniversity and further educationgovernment and politicsfederal   state issuesstates and territoriessatasadelaide 5000australia     First posted           December 26 2013 101313       More stories from South Australia

<DOC_NAME>Sydney to Hobart: Race start never ceases to enthral and amaze</DOC_NAME>
<TEXT>
As dawn broke over the Cruising Yacht Club of Australia the skies were brooding and hanging low but the sight of a patch of blue was enough to bring hope of better things to come With a steady southerly breeze pushing seemingly endless amounts of grey cloud our way it seemed the Sydney to Hobart would start in less than picture postcard weather By lunchtime that had all changed The skies broke up steadily through the morning and by the time competitors spectators and media took to the water the harbour looked its very best crystal blue with puffs of bright white cloud above   The only real cloud hung over the coast to the south of the city a way of reminding the fleet that fair weather is never far away from the foul On the water itself the yachts manoeuvred with precise elegance  To be only a few metres from Perpetual Loyal as she adjusted her sails was to be reminded of her awesome power The smaller yachts looked a picture as the spectator fleet respectfully kept their distance In a nod to the history of the race the starting gun was fired by Trygve Halversen who along with his brother Magnus won the first of three straight races on board Freya in 1963 The sight of the Sydney to Hobart fleet moving towards the heads at full speed never does cease to enthral and amaze  The 100ft super maxis as colossal as they are simply glide over the surface Their bows slicing through the swell Its clinical racing efficiency This afternoon it was Wild Oats XI so carefully and cleverly manoeuvred by her skipper Mark Richards that won the dice on the harbour and in so doing an important psychological edge over her rivals Surprisingly as the super maxis cleared away from the rest of the fleet and the spectator craft it was Beau Geste in closest pursuit not Perpetual Loyal as had been predicted On Grandstands own launch the MV Yackatoon we had the perfect view of the leaders as they rounded the seaward mark Victor and started the long unpredictable journey south The huge sails were gradually reduced in size as they disappeared into the distance The next time we see them will be on the waters of the Derwent River unless fate and misfortune intervene Todays spectacle showed us that no assumptions can be made from one hour to the next let alone one day to the next Thats the beauty of the elements so closely tied to the outcome and the conduct of this race We wait to see what nightfall and beyond brings Topicssailingother sportssportsydney 2000nswaustralia     First posted           December 26 2013 155120       More stories from New South Wales
