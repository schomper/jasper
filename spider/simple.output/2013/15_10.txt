something nobody else thought of Egypt take time there Alert moderator 15 Oct 2013 65824pm Bowker writes while symbolic consequential US message Egypt was correct move He forgot mention US Foreign Assistance Act requires suspension foreign aid country suffers military coup Albeit lot US law international relations appears more symbolic consequential nowadays Bowker appears imply obeying law optionalI also like statement concern Washington lose sight certain tangible direct US interests relationship especially respect sea air lines communication impacting US military deployments Why
