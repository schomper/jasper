<DOC_NAME>Qld Bar Association president steps away from sex offender law review</DOC_NAME>
<TEXT>
Queensland Bar Association president Peter Davis QC will take no further part in a review of the State Governments sex offender laws He had been accused of a conflict of interest because of his role in acting for the State Attorney General in attempts to keep convicted rapist Robert John Fardon behind bars But Mr Davis was also one of three authors of a submission that suggested ways of strengthening the Governments sex offender laws That revelation caused uproar at the recent Bar Association annual general meeting One of the suggestions in the submission was to reverse the onus of proof so an offender must prove on the balance of probabilities that they would comply with a supervision order if released How could you not be conscious of the apparent conflict of interest in your involvement in this fashion   The authors indicated the effect such a change might have It seems to us that each of Raymond Yeo Robert Fardon and Raymond Barry Eades would have failed that test the submission said The 15 page document also called for a review of all relevant legislation Members were upset that they only found out about the submission when Attorney General Jarrod Bleijie mentioned his discussions with the Bar Association during an interview on the ABCs 730 Queensland Dan OGorman SC who acts for Fardon said he was not consulted on the submission and did not think Mr Davis should have played any part It is unfortunate that Peter just didnt leave it to the other two members who drew it up because of his involvement in acting for the Attorney in these very matters before the court he said Another prominent barrister John Allen wrote to Mr Davis asking if he would resign as president How could you not be conscious of the apparent conflict of interest in your involvement in this fashion he said Why did you not choose to consult any members you might readily have expected to have been opposed to such a submission The dispute reared its head again last week when the Court of Appeal declared that Fardon should be released on a supervision order and that the Governments new Declarations Act was unconstitutional The act was intended to give the Attorney General power to decide if dangerous sexual offenders should be indefinitely detained Mr Bleijie responded by launching a review of the legislation as suggested by the Bar Association in its previous submission This time Mr Davis says he will play no part He wrote to Bar Association members this week to say a working group will draw up the submission Some members have expressed concern as to my involvement in formulating any response by the Bar given that I have acted for the Attorney General in a number of dangerous prisoner cases he said I dont consider that I have been in a position of conflict However I need to ensure that no peripheral issues detract from the Bar Associations important work on this topic  Therefore I will not participate in the working group which will be headed by the vice president Do you know more Send details to investigationsabcnetau Topicsstate parliamentactivism and lobbyingjudges and legal professionsexual offencesbrisbane 4000     First posted           December 13 2013 183511       More stories from Queensland
