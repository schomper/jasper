The Brewarrina Shire Council is calling for the federal government to re introduce exceptional circumstances funding until a new drought policy can be formed The council wants the states Primary Industries Minister Katrina Hodgkinson to order the DPI to plead the case to the Commonwealth Mayor Matthew Slacksmith says while the state governments recent drought assistance package has helped ease the pressure on farmers a long term strategy from the Abbott Government is also required Until they come up with a new drought policy I think they really should just revert back to the old drought policy in the interim he said  I believe that technically its possible we wouldnt be asking for a great heap of money at once its more a change of policy in the interim until they can formulate their new drought policy  He says while the existing measures are a smart move for the future theyre useless at the moment What they came out with was good in the long term but the drought preparation things its like having ice berg awareness meetings on the Titanic   Theyre very good but we need help now and not to know about it  We dont need the awareness classes the events happened and needs to be dealt with now  Topicsdroughtruralbrewarrina 2839   More stories from New South Wales
