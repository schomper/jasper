<DOC_NAME>Accounting for the real costs of population ageing</DOC_NAME>
<TEXT>
We spent 30 years discussing economic reform And may economically literate reform debate often presents somewhat one sided view economicsSensible debate often muddled political commitment small government lead less transparent less equitable less efficient outcomesThe debate population ageing good example It become accepted wisdom population ageing require harsh new reforms reduce cost burden government On basis Howard government cut payments single parents encourage people workforce Rudd government lifted eligibility age pensionBut cost ageing artefact way Treasury accounting real crisis Treasury focuses attention government spending rather either budget whole cost society whole As result get policies minimise government spending actually increase cost budget societyHow possible Well first useful understand little likely happen next 40 years The government released three Intergenerational Reports look this These reports show number areas public spending likely rise much smaller number fall  Not increase related ageing The biggest ticket item health care Only part due ageing caused rising expectations expensive technologies   largely result affluence richer citizens demand better servicesThe goes public services Over time productivity gains manufacturing agriculture tend bring prices But services labour intensive fewer productivity gains so relatively prices rise Also degree labour intensity actually linked service quality   time want better quality services That means nurses per patient teachers per studentThis problem reflects changing consumer preferences But governments dont make computers make education health care costs government likely riseThe second issue interaction ageing family Australias population ageing less dramatic overseas According Treasury See Table 14 here 2030 almost proportion people workforce age 1970 Participation rates labour productivity also improved since 1970However 1970 care children performed unpaid mothers In 2030 care provided government older people   result changing family structures womens employment Older people also reliant government income support through pensions children This explains rising pension aged care costsBut size government problem Imagine instead discussing corporation If knew people would want products people would want higher quality versions products doubt costs would rise meet demand size corporation would grow But long people willing pay this problemAgeing presents kind situation Raising taxes pay expanded public spending particularly health main component ageing budget widely supportedHowever Treasury focuses size government spending whole picture While looks detail spending change simply assumes taxes stay same Not surprisingly results predicted deficit calls reduce spendingBut increases government spending reflect real demands economy   demands health education pensions aged care facilities There strong political pressure something Yet often demands meet less transparent often less efficient waysThe worst example social tax expenditures   set policies provide social support granting tax breaks   cost tens billions every year For example instead paying full rate tax super contributions taxed concessional tax rate 15 per centTax expenditures operate much like spending People gain benefits spend invest money certain ways Both tax expenditures spending cost budget money direct resources certain sectors economy redistribute income Imagine comparing two schemes In one people gain rebate every time make contributions say health insurance In another people contribute get tax break The effects two schemes incentive contribute budget bottom line second tax expenditure appear budget papersThis lack transparency makes poor policy For example super tax concession grossly inequitable Benefits linked marginal tax rate meaning top rate earning 180000 pa get back 30 per cent minimum wage already pay 15 per cent marginal rate get nothingPartly inequity also grossly inefficient While one aim super reduce future spending pension virtually n saving government tax concession goes high income earners unlikely ever get pension For every 1 spent tax concessions 10c saved pension costs  effective loss 90 per cent investmentThis appalling value money tax concessions small scheme either They cost 20 billion year See items C5 C6 hereabout pension projected continue rising Yet tax expenditure subject normal budgetary scrutiny appear anywhere Intergenerational Report Instead targeting expensive inefficient inequitable scheme would help pay health aged care government raised age getting pension saving little adversely affecting lowest paid workers mainly womenIt similar case housing Housing actually important part ageing story welfare system assumes people stable low cost housing retirement If retirees either home public housing life bad If renting privately real risk extreme povertyLike super main support housing tax system The tax exemption family home costs 45 billion year negative gearing investors costs 5 billion The biggest benefits go highest income earners indeed negative gearing worth much someone average wage Negative gearing also grossly inefficient pushes house prices making harder low income families get house expensive government subsidise rentsLikewise rebates cause similar although less severe problems Giving people money pay health insurance childcare tends push price services It means total cost including taxes pocket costs higher governments provide services directly This governments often better position negotiate costs individual consumers So schemes give us subsidies might cost governments less providing services costs us as consumers tax payers moreThe aim government minimize spending narrowly constructed exclude tax concessions It ensure services provided lowest cost society And surprisingly want provide health care simply providing directly turns much cheaper The goes housing child care income insuranceSo it The first step try bring hidden costs budget open Making tax expenditures formal part budget good start Even better replace equivalent rebates Its hard imagine government could maintain scheme gave top tax rate average 11000 year nothing minimum wage  like super tax concessionsNext make sure budgeting includes total cost providing service including out of pocket costs genuine comparisons made If raising taxes pay services also lowers cost living pressures even tax governments justify spendingAnd finally lets get worked population ageing Living longer

<DOC_NAME>Q&A - Dam expert analyses Wivenhoe</DOC_NAME>
<TEXT>
Within days devastating Brisbane flood questions raised handling water releases Wivenhoe Dam Wivenhoe originally designed mitigate possibility similar flood event 1974 floods ABC Online spoke Professor Hubert Chanson expert dam reservoir engineering extensive firsthand knowledge Wivenhoe system While stressing comments based real time data dam offered observations situation Q How Wivenhoe Dam work water supply flood mitigator The Wivenhoe reservoir maximum situation capacity 220 per cent water supply volume That first 100 per cent drinking next 120 per cent mitigate floods try reduce discharge stream Wivenhoe Dam However reservoir reaches levels greater 180 190 per cent safety dam starts become major concern Wivenhoe Dam one overtopped In words water level reached 220 225 per cent capacity high risk water pass dam wall itself This lead damage wall ultimately leading potential failure dam structure Q Can describe situation occurred lead up recent flooding Brisbane Ipswich I think need look context happened 10 days ago   start Friday 7th January onward We situation catchments upstream Wivenhoe Dam soaked full water walked fields paddocks get water shoes simply reflects fact nearly four months continuous rain Queensland When situation additional rain able infiltrate soil instead going run gravity downward Wivenhoe Dam So situation Friday January 7 onward rain went directly Wivenhoe reservoir So rapid flow Wivenhoe Dam combination catchment soaked already upstream Somerset Dam already full capacity fairly intense rainfall I think looking somewhere region 100 200 millimetres rain every day four days continuously So Friday dam basically maximum water supply 100 per cent heavy rainfall Saturday Sunday Monday Tuesday led situation Wivenhoe Dam filling quickly reaching water level 190 per cent full water supply volume Q There reports saying dam operators released water perhaps level Wivenhoes 100 per cent drinking reservoir offset floods think wise This difficult question its one politicians tried play games with Lets remember back 2007 Queensland middle period nearly eight nine years drought In 2007 water level Wivenhoe Dam 15 per cent Wivenhoe Dam major water supply south east Queensland reduce water supply capacity dam present 100 per cent gambling upon long term water supply south east Queensland Q What thoughts criticism operation Wivenhoe Dam general efforts made prevent flooding Queensland During 2010 11 floods number major dams helped reduce water level flooding major areas The Wivenhoe definitely played major role reducing flooding Brisbane The Paradise Dam played major role reduce levels water Bundaberg Logan city spared major flooding recent dam completed one month ago We major flooding south east Queensland past 10 days involved three different catchments flood Wivenhoe The Brisbane Valley blocked Wivenhoe reservoir Lockyer Valley particular massive deadly flash flooding Toowoomba Grantham Bremer River flowing Ipswich Now flooding took place Ipswich Brisbane River combination floods coming three different catchments time right situation Bremer River doesnt major dam reservoir Q A lot Queensland towns cities including Brisbane built floodplains realistic expect solutions completely protect areas flooding A lot cities towns Queensland built around rivers Rockhampton Bundaberg Brisbane Ipswich name it And cities townships developed floodplain areas The city Brisbane built floodplain Brisbane River need understand may subjected floods need individual community make decision whether prepared flooded not And one needs remember traditional Queenslander home one built stumps living areas upstairs downstairs area could flooded When buy property Brisbane floodplain take risk house flooded You aware need take individual responsibility Q Politicians also calling dams built around Queensland mitigate potential impact future floods Do think dams need built Queensland It delicate sensitive topic I need careful wording response In Queensland lot reservoirs dams tend dual purposes one water supply flood mitigation flood protection There doubt water infrastructure Queensland almost adequate increasing population have Weve situation lacking water supply community reservoirs dams needed definitely provided properly designed properly integrated catchment provide water supply community one cannot dismiss important role dams reservoirs At time one looked flooding doubt Queenslanders live across tropical region important floods taking place regularly need protect population I think community including politicians need make decisions whether prepared flooded every five 10 20 50 years Q Do think debate flooding building dams politicised I fully agree observation debate started politicised And I think people remember pretty basic facts First live floodplain   prepared accept water cuts dry periods Are prepared accept flooded every five 10 years If answer yes clearly issue building dams issue simply get water cuts regularly drought flooded every two five years If hand developed country expect water supply 247 even drought period want protection medium to major flood I think need serious need protection systems including dams reservoirs But live floodplain live area long dry periods secure water supply dry periods How protect people floods Thats something public individual ask herself And I think message people forget often I think much political debate enough people thinking basics Topics rivers disasters and accidents floods dams and reservoirs brisbane 4000 qld ipswich
