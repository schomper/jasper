storyline This event always large diameter tropical storm likely minor moderate effects   mainly trees powerlines   wide area Peak winds never likely exceed 150 kmhr 41 ms less required design level Brisbane buildings Unfortunately US building standards quite patchy smaller communities always likely suffer building damage cities   never sensational level media stories Alert moderator 01 Sep 2011
