In light recent debate NSW Greens policy boycotting Israel many proponents BDS Boycott Divestment Sanctions campaign Israel attempting portray campaign something original groundbreaking even Lee Rhiannon even said Greens would performed better NSW election amplify support BDS show part international movement In fact far breaking ground movement simply re hashing 90 year old policy failed fail againSince 1922 Fifth Arab Congress proposed boycott Jewish businesses British Mandate Palestine someone boycotting Israel one guise another The League Arab Nations boycotted Zionist entities one first points business formed 1945 Israel even existed Once Israel became state boycott strengthened include companies ties companies business IsraelThe aim boycott never peaceful solution conflict creation Palestinian state  fact West Bank Gaza occupied Jordan Egypt first 20 years The Arab nations invaded Israel soon became state 1948 continued officially war Israel least peace treaty Egypt 1979 To day two Arab states Egypt Jordan recognise Israel extent allow tourists Israeli stamps passports country The Arab boycott aimed destruction Israel stateThe boycott never binding however almost soon implemented Arab states set about creating series loopholes irregular application procedures order protect economies actual harm whilst still paying lip service economic belligerence Israel It collapsed fall USSR today find Israeli companies trading Arab countries albeit especially openlyThis last anyone heard it however In 2001 UN determined hold World Conference Racism Racial Discrimination Xenophobia Related Intolerance Durban South Africa A months due take place group South African Muslims decided form organisation called National Consultative Forum Palestine NCFP In words spokesman Naeem Jeenah NCFP activists most Islamists decided ensure promoted Palestinian cause broad human rights issue rather Muslim one In practice meant using language movement familiar South Africans  anti Apartheid campaign  reframe Islamist rejection Israel human rights issueThe NCFP successfully lobbied South African trade unions NGOs organisation known Palestine Solidarity Committee far left secular organisation allowing hijack debate Conference As result NGO forum Durban managed ignore boundless discrimination around world condemn Israel  apparently Palestinians group world suffering discrimination Darfuris Egyptian Copts Iranian Bahais Turkish Kurds Tibetans Indigenous Australians Native Americans every group deserve mentionThe arguments used favour Apartheid comparison spurious best downright racist worst It demands return Israel every person descended Palestinian fled conflict 1948 compares Israels refusal allow Apartheid policy herding black people Bantustans This overlooks roughly equal number Jews simultaneously forced flee Arab countries compensationIt claims Israel European colonial enterprise discriminates non Europeans theocracy Jews get special rights This ridiculous claim  law every Israeli citizen equal rights Israel one multi ethnic societies world Ethiopians Russians Indians many Jews around Middle East North AfricaIn fact 20 per cent Israelis non Jewish mostly Arabs given rights law Israeli citizen sat Supreme Court worked ambassadors Foreign Ministry served army played national sports teams general involved aspects civil society By comparison South Africa black people made up close 80 per cent population even allowed sit benches white people never mind above mentioned achievements This say Israeli Arabs suffer discrimination far better off Indigenous Australians British Pakistanis various minorities Western countries  especially Arab countries entitled free speech freedom persecution women homosexualsNevertheless BDS founder Omar Barghouti number others seized comparison formed entire movement around known PACBI Palestinian campaign Academic Cultural Boycott Israel launched April 2002 PACBI attempt target Israel kind boycott campaign waged South Africa 1970s 80s It met start derision condemnation marred discrimination racismPACBI saw Hillel Jewish students association Concordia University Canada banned 2002 well St Cloud State University Minnesota paying US365000 compensation December 2002 department administrators tried discourage students taking courses taught Jewish colleagues It lost momentum UK Egyptian English academic fired two Israelis journal edited one former Amnesty International chair purely boycott Because incidents like this PACBI died almost soon started Barghouti current doctoral student Tel Aviv University since claimed started 2004  presumably avoid embarrassing scrutiny failureHowever International Court Justice ICJ gave judgment security barrier Israel constructing which successfully reduced deaths due terrorism 450 2002 none 2008 Barghouti allies saw opportunity compare 1971 condemnation South African Apartheid ICJ re launch boycott effort time moniker BDS This policy NSW Greens endorsed December last year Marrickville City Council implemented week later  costing Fiona Byrne seat NSW Legislative Assembly  currently pushed various hard left AustraliaWhile proponents BDS made claim not anti Israel looking rather peaceful solution conflict even cursory examination would say otherwise The proposition descendents Palestinians fled 1948 return  ie sudden influx millions immigrants  would destroy Israel state Similarly idea Israel colonial enterprise denies Jewish people right exist people right self determination ironically accusing Palestinians Barghouti coyly admitted occasions believe Israel exist stateThe worst thing however BDS actually hurts Palestinians damages chances peace In 2002 result boycott Norwegian scientist refused send genetic material Jerusalem hospital transpired intended treating Palestinians blood disease While BDS movement used Israeli security measures West Bank checkpoints curfews order drive recruitment ironically removed result cooperation Palestinian Authority Israel  causing Barghouti believes dialogue illogical wrong dub PA quisling governmentAll serious policy IsraeliPalestinian conflict
