encyclopaedias along books areas like politics morality It referred recently retired policy required library throw 50000 books per year The article also painted images loads books taken away skipsThe professors arms one might expect lined provide Herald quote One observed horror Theyre getting rid books make space students sit around lunch plug laptops in A former library assistant maintained libraries see function archive UNSW Library seem regard akin video store Angry letters editor ensued including one made comparisons book burning contained Ray Bradburys Fahrenheit 451More recently Herald turned focus University Sydneys Fisher Library report apparently planning get rid 30 staff remove 500000 books journals part major redevelopment planIn fiery QA session University librarian John Shipp explained 58 per cent books remained un borrowed last 5 years When questioners asked knew un borrowed books werent used within library replied librarians employed the dust test He also explained redevelopment plans include study space 24 hour access exam periods and inevitably coffee cartThe students seemed less than convinced dust test proceeded organise mass book borrowing action presumably aimed stirring dust metaphorically literallyThe upshot this earlier piece UNSW observed initiate an ideological row function modern research libraries The response anyone working within academic library sector is its timeAcademic libraries like UNSW Library Fisher Library indeed grappling issues space cost changing use patterns mention rigours fiscal accountability Like many areas  think publishing writing journalism media  libraries coming terms new ways information searched accessed shared used As fields substantial self reflection fundamentals purpose role new digital

cultural memory part supporting framework civilisation itself Thus evident discomfort one UNSW professor says Theres something profoundly wrong symbolically wrong university destroying booksIt comes something shock then suddenly hear libraries taken control agendas re articulating services resources rather remaining quiet academic handmaidens To academics seems appear like strange news distant star threatening upset current alignment planets We need write newspapers Shouldnt library build another floorClearly libraries respond new challenges well poorly supported criticised like institution depending changes fall The Fisher Library denies redevelopment connected staff redundancies protection livelihoods university workers important concern many us sectorThis doesnt change fact that Seth Godin wrote recently the library longer warehouse dead books Lets add anyone thinks main role academic library maintain archive hasnt paying attentionFalling kind cultural pessimism probably bad adopting breathless enthusiasm faced change appears unrelenting inevitable often conceived fog technological determinism Its easy trivialise change battering civilisation coming coffee shops Perhaps instead its time regard moment choiceLets firstly remind access information spaces staff within average academic library incomparably better decade ago Lets also recognise avoid defensive postures then like areas publishing journalism libraries cant anything part conversation game changing issues faceThe library well placed institutional history human resources strongly held ethos negotiate new
